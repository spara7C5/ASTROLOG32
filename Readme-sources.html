<br>

<br>

<big>Welcome to Astrolog32. This is a Windows 32 bits version of
Astrolog. It is based on Astrolog 5.41g for MS Windows by Walter
Pullen, as modified by Valentin Abramov. </big><big>For a list of
changes done from 5.41g, please look at&nbsp;file "History
A32.html". That file is distributed in the </big><big>Astrolog32
binaries zip file.</big><br>

<big>
<br>

</big><br>

<big><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Operating
Systems Supported<br>

<br>

</span></big></big></big><big>This
source code has been built for Windows 32 bits. It runs on MS Windows
98, Millennium Edition, NT 4.0, 2000, XP. It was not tested, but is
expected to run on </big><big>MS Windows Server 2003.<br>

<br>

</big><big>Unlike other versions of Astrolog that contain source code
for several OSes, Astrolog32 is strictly a MS Windows 32 bits
application. <br>

</big><big><br>

</big><br>

<br>

<big><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How to build
Astrolog32<br>

<br>

</span></big></big></big><big>Visual C++ v. 6.0 with service pack 6 was
used to build
Astrolog32, together with the Platform SDK of March 2003. You may not
need the service pack or the Platform SDK, but if you have a different
compiler you will need to create&nbsp;project or make files yourself -
unless the compiler converts them from version 6.0.<br>

<br>

</big><big>Astrolog32 currently uses Swiss Ephemeris static libraries.
With respect to libraries, you have at least three options: <br>

</big>
<ul>

  <li><big>Use DLLs available from AstroDienst, and change </big><big>the
Astrolog32 project file to use them instead of static libraries. </big></li>

  <li><big>Download </big><big>Swiss Ephemeris from AstroDienst and
create your own static </big><big>libraries. </big></li>

  <li><big>Use ready-made libraries available in the file
"SE167Libs.zip" from the same site where you got the </big><big>Astrolog32
sources.</big></li>

</ul>

<big>We recommend the last option, at least intially, as it is the
easiest. Inside "SE167Libs.zip" there is a readme with instructions on
how to use the libraries. <br>

<br>

Once you have the </big><big>Swiss Ephemeris librarie</big><big>s
sorted out, put </big><big>Astrolog32
in any directory you want (for example, C:\astrolog32\sources). Then
double click on the workspace file (astrolog.dsw). This should start
Visual C++. Then press F7 to build. Both a Release and Debug
configurations are available in the project file. We suggest you use
the Release version, unless you want to debug. </big><big>To change
the
configuration being built go to the Build menu, and choose "Select
Active Configuration".<br>
