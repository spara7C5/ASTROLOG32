<blockquote><p><a name="b3">
In</a> <b>Canada</b>, time-zones span the country east-to-west:<ul>
<li>Newfoundland, (Gander, St Johns) is U.T.-3.30hrs.</li>
<li>New Brunswick is U.T.-4, as is Nova Scotia (e.g.Halifax).</li>
<li>Eastern Ontario (e.g Toronto, Ottawa, i.e. east of 60W) and Quebec (e.g Montreal) use the US's EST, UT-5.</li>
<li>Manitoba (Winnepeg), west Ontario (Thunder Bay), and the S.E. corner of Saskatchewan match CST, UT-6.</li>
<li>Alberta (Calgary, Edmonton), with most of NorthWest Terr., and most of  Saskatchewan (see above), keep the US's MST, UT-7. <i>In 1960, NorthWest Terr. used 5 zones: E of W, 68W, UT-4; 68W to  85W, UT-5; 85W to 102W, UT-6; 102W to 120W, UT-7; 120W westward, UT-8.</i></li><li>British Columbia, mostly, (e.g Vancouver), and Yukon match PST, UT-8.</li></ul>
Before 1906, no zones applied and LMT should be used.<br>
There are many inconsistencies by individual city or town: see <a href="#ca"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>.<br>Saskatchewan alone does not apply a summertime shift.
<p>

<b>United States</b> has five onshore time-zones, all with <a href="#us"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, except Arizona in the UT-7 zone, which had DST in only one year - 1967. <ul><li> 
<b>Eastern Standard</b>, (EST), UT-5; States are: ..DE, D.Columbia, FL [1], GA, SC, NC, VI, KY, IN [2], OH, MI [3], PA, NY, MA, RI, NJ, ME, VT, NH, CO, MD.</li><li><b>Central Standard</b>, (CST), UT-6; States are:  ..eastern ND, MO, MS, IL, eastern SD, IA, NE, MN, WI, TX, AR, TN, AL, LA</li><li><b>Mountain Standard</b>, (MST), UT-7; States are:  MT, ID, WY, western SD, western ND, AZ, NM, UT.</li><li><b>Pacific Standard</b>, (PST), UT-8;  States are: ..CA, WA (state), OR, NV.</li><li><b>Alaska Standard</b> (AKST) is UT-9; &nbsp; but at this latitude, a small distance east or west translates to an huge shift of noon-time, and in Nome, noon is at 3pm AKST; in Fairbanks, sunset in summer is after midnight AKST. <i>In 1960, Alaska had <b>three</b> timezones, UT-8 round Juneau, UT-9 from Cross Sound to 141W, UT-10 from 141W to 162W. A base-time of UT+9, generally, came in on 30 Nov. 1983.</i> Abolishing DST has been proposed, twice, since.</li></ul>
Some Exceptions:<br>[1] West Florida is UT-6;<br>[2] Indiana, in 2006, lost 8 counties in the west from the more generally adopted UT-5, to the UT-6 which 10 counties had already decided on<br>[3] In Michigan, the counties of Gogerbie, Iron, Dickinson &amp; Menominee are in UT-6 zone.<p><b>U.S. Offshore</b>, Hawaii and the Aleutian Isl. keep UT-10, <i>Until Sept 1945, Hawaii's zone was UT-10.30</i> - (they had permanent wartime DST 9 Feb '42 to 30 Sep '45); Midway UT-11; American Samoa is UT-11; Panama UT-5 - all with no DST.<br>The Marshall Islands UT<b>+</b>12. Guam UT<b>+</b>10.<br>Puerto Rico is UT-5, and had DST only in 1941-'45.<p>

<b>Central America</b>: In Mexico, and the rest of Central America (not Panama), the timezone is UT-6 (which is CST in US). <i>(In 1960, Narayit, Sinaloa, the Southern district of Lower California and Sonora kept UT-7;  the Northern district of Lower California kept UT-8.)</i>. Before recent times, Mexico's timezone history has been chequered: UT-7 before 1927, and after Nov 1930; after 16 Dec '43, UT-5. 1944 May 1 re-adopted UT-6. One modern map suggests that the NW state of Sonora keeps UT-7, while Baja Calif. Norte keeps UT-8. Mexico has various DST arrangements - <a href="#mx"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>. <br>Others at UT-6 are: Costa Rica <a href="#co"><f7>[DST]</f7></a> (may not be current), Guatemala <a href="#gt"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, Honduras <a href="#ho"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, and Nicaragua (not current) <a href="#nc"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, Belize, El Salvador.<p>Only Panama uses UT-5 <a href="#pn"><f7>[DST]</f7></a><p>
The <b>West Indies</b> are largely UT-4; this covers Anguilla, Antigua, Montserrat, Dominica, Barbados, Dominican Rep. (from UT-4.40' on 1 Apr 1933 to UT-5; 1974, oct 27, to UT-4) <a href="#dr"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, Grenada, Martinique, Guadeloupe, St Lucia, Virgin Isl., and Puerto Rico; Nevis &amp; Kitts, Trinidad &amp; Tobago. So too, Bermuda.<p>The following are UT-5:<br>The Bahamas <a href="#bh"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, Cuba <a href="#cu"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, Jamaica, Haiti, and the Cayman Is. - these all maintain UT-5. Turks &amp; Caicos, Netherlands Antilles (Curacao), no DST, <i>(in 1960 was UT-4.30)</i>.<br>
Saint Pierre and Miquelon uses UT-3, <a href="#spm"><f7>[DST]</f7></a> <i>(in 1960 was UT-3)</i>
<p>
<a name="b5"><b>Russia &amp; satellite states</b></a>, after abandoning DST in 2010, have moved to new all-year times, across all zones, as of 28 Oct, 2011. (Moldova may do the same). <a href="#ru"><f7>[DST]</f7></a><ul><li>On the European side of Russia, Kalliningrad on the Baltic  (formerly Konigsberg), and Belarus keep UT+3, which they call MSK-1.</li><li>Moscow zone (MSK time) is UT+4 now, and Samara, Saratov, Kazan, Volgograd and Voronezh, all also UT+4.</li><li>UT+5 is not used.</li><li>Yekaterinburg is the main city in zone UT+6, which includes Perm, Omsk, Ufa, Chelyabinsk.</li><li>Krasnoyarsk is UT+8. (Little habitation to the east of it!).</li><li>At the Pacific coast, Yakutsk is UT+10, Vladivostok is UT+11hrs. (with most of Sakhalin Oblast), Kamchatka is UT+12 (Magadan, eastern Sakha Republ.).</li></ul>
<i>Old Russian times: Solar time (use LMT) was in use until late nineteenth century (1890s), when Moscow time was declared as UT+2.30. However, when the Soviet Union was created, Moscow Time became UTC+2 and the various other time zones were introduced throughout Russia and the rest of the Soviet Union.<br><img src="Prechange-russia-time.gif" width="464" border="0" align="right"/> On June 21, 1930, the Soviet Union advanced all clocks by one hour, so Moscow's MST became UT+3, and see other zones for the addition, right.</i><br clear="right">
<p>
<a name="b2"><b>Africa</b></a> has four timezones (and very few countries have had DST; only Algeria <a href="#aa">DST</a>, Egypt <a href="#et"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, Madagascar  <a href="#md"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, Morocco <a href="#mr"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, Namibia, Rep.

Tunisia abandoned it in 2009, Egypt in 2011, Madagascar, 1954, Rep. South Africa, 1944.<p>
 
WEST: In Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Sierre Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, also Morocco (which adopted UT in 1913, 26 oct, 00.30am.) , and Western Sahara, it's UT, (= GMT).

<p>WESTERN CENTRAL: in a zone including Libya and Namibia, and west of a line between them towards the nations listed above, all countries use UT +1<br> - that's Algeria, (adopted UT 10 mar 1911; from 1900 — 1911 it was Paris Time, UTC +0:09:21; before that, use lmt) 
<a href="#aa"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, Nigeria (adopted UT+1 on 31 Aug 1919, and before that, use lmt), Niger, Benin, Cameroon &amp; its islands, Equatorial Guinea &amp; Annobon Is., Chad, Gabon, Central African Rep., Angola, Tunisia  <a href="#tu"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, and the western Congo, (like Kinshasa).

<p>EASTERN CENTRAL: east of that line from Libya to Namibia, and excepting those below, nations use UT+2<br> - Burundi, Democratic Rep of Congo (Kisangani, Katanga -eastern), Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique, down to Malawi and Rep. South Africa <a href="#za"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>. Egypt <a href="#et"><f7>[DST]</f7></a> and Libya are also on UT+2.<p>

EAST: the countries near the east coast, from Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Somaliland, Kenya, down to Uganda and Tanzania, with Madagascar (since 1911) <a href="#md"><f7>[DST]</f7></a>, and the Comoros Is., all use timezone UT+3.<br>

 Mexico is complex: most does have DST (it started 1996, Apr - Oct), but Baja California, much of Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, have an even longer summer DST, running sometimes into November. On the other hand, Sonora has no DST. In the past, this diversity was reflected in different national timezones.<p>

It is said: many (mainly indigenous) people of southern Mexico refuse to apply it.

Starting in 1909, the Honourable Sir Thomas Kay Sidey put forward Bills to advance the clocks an hour, and The Summer Time Act 1927 brought it in: first Sunday in November to the first Sunday in March. This proved unpopular; the Summer Time Act 1928 revised this to a half-hour shift from the 14 October 1928 (second Sunday) to 17 March 1929 (third Sunday), and The Summer Time Act 1929 fixed this half-hour shift to run from the second Sunday in October to the third Sunday in March.<br>In 1933, the period was extended from the first Sunday in September to the last Sunday in April. This continued until the Second World War, when emergency regulations in 1941 extended daylight saving to cover the whole year, re-applied until the Standard Time Act of 1945 made the abandonment of NZMT permanent in 1946, so what had beencalled N.Z. Summer Time (NZST) became N.Z. Standard Time.<br>
By the Time Act 1974, the Governor-General could declare a period when Daylight Time is to be observed. This was a one-hour shift (on top of the earlier half-hour shift) from the first Sunday in November to the last Sunday in February, promptly changed the next year by The New Zealand Time Order 1975 which fixed the period of observance from the <b>last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in March</b>.<br>
AS a consequence of the survey and further feedback, in 1988 the Minister of Internal Affairs arranged for a trial of extended NZDT to be held from the second Sunday in October 1989 to the third Sunday in March 1990, and The Daylight Time Order 1990 declared that NZDT would run from 2 am NZST on the first Sunday in October to 3 am NZDT on the third Sunday in March.<br>
On 30 April 2007 the government announced that it had extended the daylight saving period from 24 to 27 weeks. From September 2007, daylight saving is now observed from the <b>last Sunday in September until the first Sunday in April</b>.<br>From 30 April 2007, DST begins 02:00 NZST on the last Sunday in September, and ends at 03:00 NZDT (or 02:00 NZST as defined in the Time Act 1974) on the first Sunday in April.

<a name="uk"><b>United Kingdom</b></a><br>has had DST since May 1916,  and separate ordinances for the kingdom's islands were ended with UK Summer Time Act, 1922 - an Act to provide for the time in Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man being in advance of Greenwich mean time during a certain period.<p>Subsequently it has continued, the authorities only interrupting it with '<b>British Standard Time 1968-71</b>' and compounding it with an extra hour during <b>'British WarTime' 1941-'45</b> and in <b>1947</b>.<br>
(During the Second World War, DST was continuous in practice, Jan 1 - Dec 31; as well, the clocks in Britain & N.Ireland made a second leap in the middle of summer. This so-called War-Time <i>plus</i> DST ended 1945, although in 1947, due to severe fuel shortages, clocks were again advanced by one hour on <b>two</b> occasions during the spring, and put back by one hour on <b>two</b> occasions during the autumn. - <i>see below</i>.) &nbsp; So, GMT was not in use at all, from Feb 25, 1940 to Oct 7, 1945, nor from 18 feb 1968 to 31 oct 1971.<p>

And in years that followed '47, clocks went back to being on UT (GMT) in winter, and advanced by one hour each spring/ put back by an hour each autumn, until the <br><b>1968 - '71</b> experiment with no DST, but the clocks advanced to UT+1 year-round. It was called British Standard Time, starting 18 Feb. 1968, (when the clocks went forward), and brought to an end in 31 Oct 1971 (driven by the chagrin of a nation struggling to work an hour and a half before sun-up), when UT &amp; DST resumed again. (<i>See below</i> )<p>&nbsp; In the years up to joining the E.U.'s start dates, the UK's DST rule put the one hour's advance on GMT at 2am on the day following the third Saturday in March, ending 2am on the day following the fourth Saturday in October, each summer.<br>E.U.-wide standard times of DST were not adopted until the nineties, and ratified 2001.<p>

Since 1997, UK (with Jersey, Guernsey, and N. Ireland) has been conformable with the EU-agreed (Directive 97/44/EC) dates for starting and ending. For details, see <f7><a href="#b4">DST section</a></f7>.<br><f7><a href="#top">top</a></f7><p>

<a name="ur"><b>Uruguay</b></a><br>
has observed DST since 2004; DST first tried 1923-'26,  then '33-'43, '59-'60, '65-'70, 1972, '74-'80, '87-'93, and since 2004. <f7>[en.wikip]<br>
 <a href="#top">top</a></f7><p>

<a name="us"><b>U.S.A.</b></a><br>
Beginning 1918 during the First World War, DST was voted down August of that year. It was federally re-instated in 1926 while allowing states much choice; most states west of the Mississippi, and those south of the Ohio, did not adopt it.<p>In the Second World War its general imposition ran Feb 9, 1942, to Sep 30, 1945, without a break - so all charts between those dates should be erected applying DST to the base-time.<p>In 1945 it reverted States' (or cities'!) choices until 1966, and during this time it was near universal in PE, MA, DE, and states to the north and east of those. Also DST was used in California and Nevada. But between, to quote Wikipedia, &quot;In 1954, only a few cities between Nevada and St. Louis, Miss. had DST&quot;. By 1966, cities' discretionary adoptions had made the situation chaotic.<br>
The Uniform Time Act of 13 Apr 1966 obliged each state to choose whether or not to adopt, though a state spanning in a neighbouring time-zone could opt that part out; commonly, the rule adopted was <i>last Sunday in March; last Sunday in October</i> (but there are exceptions - as an example, Alaska adopted 'last week April to last week October', from 1969 to 1986; 'first week April to last week October' after that).<br>Indiana and Alaska opted out, but soon re-joined the vast majority. But Arizona, which for a few months in 1967 had DST, has stayed at base-time <b>all year</b> ever since.<br> In 1974-5, the oil crisis caused the near year-long extension of DST; public opposition ended that long DST.<p>Finally, in March 11, 2007, DST was re-designated to run <i>2nd Sunday in March; first Sunday in November</i>.
Some states, like Indiana and Alaska, are considering abandoning DST again. <br>US offshore islands are listed separately.<br><f7>
 <a href="#top">top</a></f7><br><p>
<a name="sov"><b>U.S.S.R.</b> had no DST apart from the 1930 'accidental' timechange, until the union breakup 1980, when it was begun on the 1st Apr 1981. It ended 2010.</a><br><f7>
 <a href="#top">top</a></f7><p>

<a name="ws"><b>Western Sahara</b></a><br>
has used Northern hemisphere DST each summer since 2008, starting then on Jun 1 to Sep 1. (Later years, Mar to Aug)<br>In 2014, it was interrupted for Ramadan, thus:<br>20 Mar - 28 Jun<br>
