.ATL  & .DAT FILES<br>
These are plain text files with some extra precision in the way that the characters are laid out; which means that programs can read them too. They go with Astrolog like punch-cards go with clocking-in. They open in Notepad, and can be looked at, and altered with due care.<p>

COMMAND-LINE in ASTROLOG<br>
A field, for codes to be inserted; a bit simpler than DOS; and <b>[Run]</b>, the command-line window, is separate from the results. (See Command Switch, which you type into it.)<p>

COMMAND SWITCH<br>
Very short codes, bashed into Astrolog's command-line. A list of many is linked into this Companion: see "Command Switches & Obscure". Several can be typed in a sequence, and then executed all at once.<p>

CONFIG.FILE<br>
It's like the old Windows registry, in that 1: it gets read by Astrolog every launch; and 2: you can edit it, so Astrolog performs differently for you. Because of that, it opens in Notepad although its name is Astrolog32.DAT! (See ".atl & .dat files"). Most tweaks you can now do through the menus, but before, this file had to be opened, editted by hand, then saved.<br>Still, if you make menu changes at each session, and want them to stick, the Config.file must be re-written with your current choices, and you can do this most simply by going <b>[File] > [Save current settings]</b>, and going 'OK'.<p>
Lines in the Config.file rely on code, because the program has to read it, but the codes are explained, in helpfile.txt and in Config.file itself.<p>

CUSPS<br>
In Astrolog, cusp refers only to the angle where one house ends, and the next starts.<p>

DAYLIGHT-SAVING TIME<br>This is not a particular <b>world-time</b> but any government's annual change on their nation's base-time, of <b>1 hour forward</b> (usually to make people work more, or use less energy). Made and un-made on a yearly basis, DST can run spring to autumn or exceptionally, all-year-round, as in wars.
<p>
DECANS<br>
The zodiacal circle is divided not into twelve, but into thirty-six parts, of 10 degrees, each called a decan. (This equivalates to the Third Harmonic.)<p>
DEFAULT<br>
How a thing is set-up at first, before you customise it.
<p>
DE-RESTRICTION - Allowing to be calculated- and-shown.<br>see RESTRICTION, <i>below</i>.<p>

DIRECTORIES<br>
These are the sub-folders within the 'Astrolog32' wrapper-folder.<br>In the Astrolog32 Config.file, it refers to the address-paths - from root folder to the relevant Astrolog subfolder - that enable Astrolog32 to find its sub-folders, such as \Ephemeris or \Atlases, \Interpretations or \Miscellaneous.<br>
Astrolog32 has a default expectation of where they are, but if they are unzipped elsewhere, you will get dialogs warning "Cannot find..." such and such.
You can edit the Config.file, though, to tell Astrolog32 where to find them: sample lines are at the end of the "CUSTOMISING DEFAULTS via CONFIG. FILE" section of the Companion.<p>
DISPOSITORS<br>
These are the planets 'ruling' each sign, and as a result, they 'disposit' any planets in the signs they 'rule', as a result limiting those 'ruled' planets' aim and reach, in other words, their 'disposition' and mode of action.<p>
EASTING<br>
'Easting' is shifting a chart's location by degrees,  minutes and seconds of arc, to a more easterly zone or longitude.<br>'Westing' is shifting to a more westerly one.<p>
FIXED STARS<br>
traditional name for the stars, as distinct from the planets (Errant Stars), and Shooting Stars: fixed stars don't have apparent motion.<p>

FLAG PARAMETER<br>
Lofty scientific term for a number used as a signal of a value, not of 'number'. A parameter is a particular quality or quantity of an object, as with The Beatles' Submarine: colour parameter = Yellow. A flag parameter is a number, perhaps in a series, or chain, of numbers, where the program reads a value for a number: a 4="green", or a 1="OFF", an 0="ON".<br>The spaces between flag parameters are important, to define to you, and to the pc, the order and so the particular function of each flag.<br>
See also RANGE parameters <i>below</i><p>

GAUQUELIN SECTORS<br>
The 36 sequential sectors of decans, anti-clockwise from the Ascendant, are used in charts with good time datum,comparatively to establish statistical trends in life. After the work of M Gauquelin, - his institute has more.
<p>
HARMONIC<br>
Setting charts to their harmonic versions works like a microscope, magnifying minor aspects and a chart's overarching latent character: where one zodiac is in the real, we overlay two (or 3, 4..) <b>within</b> the one zodiac, and then compound them: oppositions are resolved as conjunctions; the signs alter (for the planets), but still carry weight!<p>
INFLUENCE<br>
In Astrolog, &quot; Influence&quot; is the quantum of power allocated to a planet or aspect, such as will feed into the algorithms that make up Pullen's calculations for relative power.<p>
LUMINARIES<br>
The Moon and the Sun are the two Luminaries, to differentiate them from planets.<p>

MACRO<br>A chain of commands in a command-line, which are remembered by an operating system or program, and can be set in train by a single switch. In Astrolog32 as in other programs, they first have to be put together, (and tested!), then 'defined', i.e. saved.. as, Macro 1, Macro 2, and so on.<p>

MAINCHART<br>This chart-thread, as opposed to charts #2, #3 etc, is the one where most of your work is done. It is the one chart-thread that is capable of saving to the \Charts folder, and the only chart that will be seen when you have "Relationship mode OFF", (which is the normal state of affairs).<p>
MISCELLANEOUS<br>
A sub-folder within the 'Astrolog32' wrapper-folder; when you install, it is empty, but images and texts created by Astrolog32 for you end up in it by default.<p>
MODULE<br>
One separate part of a greater whole, which can be dealt with on its own.<p>
OBJECT<br>
A generic name that Astrolog uses for a planet, or Luminary, or fixed star, which plays any role in the weighing of a chart.<br>See also POINTS <i>below</i>.<p>

OBJNUM<br>A 'signifier' of the kind of thing that should be inserted in a command line, - 'objnum' is found between two tag-brackets in the helpfile.. but you include neither the word 'objnum' nor the brackets when you replace it with an 'object-number'. &nbsp; You'll notice all the Objects listed in the <b>[Settings]</b> menus have numbers alongside them, so that you can tell Astrolog32 what Object you mean.<br>So OBJNUM is a proxy for some ObjectNumber to be inserted there.<p> 
POINT<br>As distinct from Objects, Points are immaterial loci, of significance in evaluating charts, like the house-cusps, the nodes, East Point, Vertex, Midheaven and Imum Coeli.<p>
PTOLEMAIC<br>
Describing the more obvious Aspects, and the veteran planets known before Herschel found Uranus; these were at the core of astrological workings for over 2000 years, and Ptolemaic still defines aspects that can disqualify a Void-of-Course Moon.<p>

RADICAL<BR>
A Radical is the chart exactly representing the spread of planets and points by degree, around the sky: that is, 'a typical birthchart', as compared to harmonic or progressed charts.
<p>
RANGE<br>
A scientific term used often in the Helpfile, and in science, having a special meaning: instead of describing things that may differ, it describes one particular bunch of similar things, to mark them out from another bunch of things of a rather different type.<br> (range), in the old Helpfile, is asking you for code, describing either for instance: the Major planets (their range code= 1 10); or another instance: the Minor planets (their range code= 11 21); or it may some other code that defines one group of objects or of aspects, as distinct from another; in different contexts, different ranges are applicable; and a knowledge of the Config.file helps to make this clear.<br>
Range parameters are fixed: not there to be editted.<p>
RECTIFICATION<br>
Adjustment, in the main, of the time of a chart, from the given time-datum. Usually done in the light of manifest characteristics of a person or event, and where th given datum is questionable.<p>
RELATIONSHIP MODE ON<br>
When Astrolog32 is in this state, the data for chart-threads other than Mainchart, are added to the charts or text-lists.<br>When it's OFF, only the Mainchart data will be seen onscreen.<p>
RESTRICTION<br>
What Astrolog calls the shutting-off of any object, or range of objects, any calculation or range of calculations, or of any view, of the many options it can do.
<p>
SIDEREAL<br>
The kind of chart-making that is much in use in countries east of the Ganges, calculating the divisions of a Zodiac from constellations' positions, or consideration of ayanamsa. Differences arise over adopting antique start-points or modern, and so, "Fagan-Bradley", "Sassanian 1", & the other options available each have their followers.<p>
SPECULUM<br>
A list of angles in a chart, of use in Directional Astrology.<p>

SWITCH<br>
Either, a keyboard-combination or single key, that you press to make a quick change - (these are keyboard switches); or, letters typed in to the command-line window, to make more profound alterations - (these are command-switches).
<p>
TOGGLE<br>
A keyboard switch which, when pressed a second time, reverses what it did the first time.<p>

TROPICAL<br>
The kind of chart-making that is the most in use in the countries west of the Ganges, calculating the divisions of a Zodiac from the Earth's orientation at Vernal Equinox.<p>

URANIANS<br>
Describes 40 or so speculative objects orbitting the Sun; see "seorbel.txt", in \main folder, to know more.<p>

WESTING<br>
See 'EASTING', <i>above</i>.<p>
