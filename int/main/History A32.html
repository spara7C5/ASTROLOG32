<big><br>
Astrolog32 is a 32 bits Windows version of Astrolog created by
Ant&#243;nio Ramos, from version 2.0 maintained by Tomas Kubec. It has its starting point in</big>
<big>Astrolog</big> <big>version 5.41g created by</big>
<big>Valentin Abramov</big><big>, which in turn originates in
Astrolog 5.40, created by Walter Pullen.<br>
<br>
</big><big>This file contains only the changes made during
Astrolog32 development.</big> <big>Changes are in chronological
order, most recent at the bottom. It only list changes in official
release versions, changes for test versions are included but do not
have separate headings.</big><br>
<big><br>
Changes from Astrolog version 1.00 through 5.40 by Walter Pullen
can be found in file "history 540.txt".<br>
<br>
Alois Treindl added support for Swiss Ephemeris to Astrolog version
5.40.<br>
<br>

Astrolog32 version 1.00 (5 March 2004)<br>
<br>
</big><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ported Astrolog from Win16 to Win32. This port
involved many changes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for example to function prototypes,
variable types, etc.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Removed Swiss Ephemeris files from Astrolog package.
Swiss Ephemeris<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is still used, but it is compiled
separately and then its library is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linked to Astrolog. This makes it easier
to upgrade in the future to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new versions of Swiss Ephemeris. Also it
makes the executable smaller<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if static libraries are used.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Reorganized the menu tree to make it more
intuitive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Changed some defaults for when the configuration
file is not found:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a graphics chart of the planets position
for the current time is shown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as opposed to a text listing of the
planets position on 19/Nov/1971,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it used to be. The dispositor's glyph
is not shown. The default<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; latitude and longitude are now zero. This
is more politically<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correct - it is some place in the Atlantic
Ocean!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Changed the configuration file name to
astrolog32.dat. Changes were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made to the file itself, typos were
corrected, some formatting changes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were done, the switch to start with a
chart for the present time was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; removed, as it is now redundant.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Added true node setting to the configuration
file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Added harmonic number to the info bar, if it is
different from one.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Reformated all source files with GNU indent, for
better readability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Moved the contents of four files, readme.541,
helpfile.540,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes.txt and power.txt into a new file
called helpfile.txt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is to make access to information
easier. Createad a Microsoft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Word version of the same file, called
helpfile.doc.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Cleaned-up headers in all source files, and
history.txt.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Changed the graphical calendar function to make it
less likely that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; text will overlap. Added a menu item for
month and year. Removed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calendar configuration item from Charts
Settings, as it is not useful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any more. Accelerator key 'K', besides
drawing the calendar as before,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also toggles between month and year.
Switch K does the same thing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the y after the K has no effect
anymore.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Added one more option for wall paper (stretch).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Created new file version.h with version name and
date, plus name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of application. This is to make it easier
to create a new build.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * RTan(r) is now defined as tan(r) also for PCs.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Fixed bug in SzTim that was causing times to be
displayed incorrectly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in some cases. (Michael Rideout)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Increased variable WHEELCOLS from 15 to 16. This is
so that house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wheels in text mode are displayed
correctly (previously columns where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not propoerly aligned, in some cases).
(Michael Rideout)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Fixed bug in PrintWheelCenter whereby string was
overflowing its<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boundary. Array szT was too small.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * In the definition of szObjName in data.c, added an
empty space<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after IC ("IC "). This is so that house
wheels in text mode are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displayed correctly for Vedic Houses and
some other house systems.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Temporarily removed version number from About dialog
for ease of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintenance.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Removed Macro 40 so that ALT F4 can perform its
usual Windows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; function.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Changed command 'x'. Before it was doing reverse
video plus graphics<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mode, now only does reverse video.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Removed hard-coded yellow text from the info bar, as
it was causing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; problems for some users. Removed also
green, so now all text in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; top part of the info bar is the same
colour, except for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application name.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Fixed a bug whereby text version of Biorhythm chart
was not being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shown if a text version of other chart was
shown previously.<br>
<br>

<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Astrolog32
version
1.05 (2 April 2004)</big><br>
<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corrected Astrolog time issue in version 1.00,
that originated when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "-n" was removed from the default configuration
file.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NOW chart is now read after the
configuration file, so the chart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will refer to the configured location. (In
version 1.00 the NOW chart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; referred to the default location (0&#186;&nbsp;
longitude, 0&#186; latitude)).<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Time minute addition to be used when NOW
charts are off" feature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has been removed, as it is now unnecessary. If
that setting appears in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the configuration file it will be ignored.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Function GetTimeNow was rewritten. It now
calls GetSystemTime instead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the standard C function "time".<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi-language support was added. Files that
are language specific now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have a two-letter termination, such as "_en" for
English, or "_fr" for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; French. A resource file and resource include
file were created for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; French. Data initialisation was moved move from
files "data.c" and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "data2.c" into "data_en.c" and "data_fr.c". File
"data2.c" was deleted.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new include file "macro_functions.h" was
created, to contain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; macro-functions previously defined in astrolog.h
and extern.h. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file is called from "astrolog.h".<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old switches and unused code for other OSes
were removed to make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Astrolog32 easier to maintain. Most of the
removed code was useless<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it would not compile or run anyway. Some Unix
code might be usable,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but there are already many Unix versions
available, so there is no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; point in keeping that code in Astrolog32.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Menus, dialogues and other text were
translated into French (mainly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by Philippe Epaud, with some translation done by
Antonio Ramos and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alexandra Lach).<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corrected old bug in NparseSz. There were
"break's" missing in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "switch" statement. Also comparison is done now
to the length of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shorter string, as opposed to only three
characters as before. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is needed to support French, where for example,
the month names "Juin"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and "Juillet" have the same three letters at the
beginning.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Month of birth in chart file is now saved as a
number instead of three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letters as before. This is so that Astrolog
versions of different<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; languages have compatible chart files.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added Sadalmalek as star #75.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corrected bug whereby Astrolog and Swiss
Ephemeris were looking for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fixed star catalogue files of different
names.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tie-in between South Node and Lilith was
removed. South Node is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now object 17 (as before) but Lilith is object
18. As a result all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other objects that come after Lilith had their
object numbers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incremented by one. South Node and Lilith can
now be displayed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; simultaneously.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Osculating Lilith is now configurable in menu
Settings/Calculations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and its configuration is saved.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second European glyph for Lilith is now
available and configurable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in menu Obscure Settings/Calculations, and its
configuration is saved.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modified alternate interpretation files,
incrementing planet number<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by 1 if equal or greater than 17. File version
was changed from 00 to 01.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; File version is now checked for configuration
and interpretation files.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Files with incompatible version numbers are not
accepted.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added terminating NULL to chLocal in function
FprocessInterpretFile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (old bug).<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modified the layout of some dialog boxes to
improve readability.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed the default for "Use Real System Fonts
In Graphic Files"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from TRUE to FALSE. This is to avoid creating
files that cannot be read<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; properly by those who do not have the necessary
fonts installed.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moved Interpretations from the View menu to
the Lists menu, as it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more logical.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corrected an old bug in function FacceptAspect
in the calculations of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aspects to the North and South Nodes.<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added version number and creation date to
Help\About dialog box.<br>

<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Astrolog32
version
1.10 (17 June 2004)</big><br>
</big>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<big>Corrected bug in 1.05 where East Point was shown with
incorrect colour.<br>
<br>
Created abbreviations for object names to be used in the info bar
and elsewhere. Fixed a few&nbsp;&nbsp; problems related to
abbreviations.<br>
<br>
Made small changes to the layout of the Influence List.<br>
<br>
Added disclaimer to About dialogue box and all source files.<br>
<br>
Created an array of flags for aspect restrictions. By default only
the first five aspects are unrestricted.<br>
<br>
The -RA switch (restrict aspects by giving them negative orbs) was
changed. It still restricts aspects, but does so by setting the
aspect, without touching the orb.<br>
<br>
The -A switch (specify the number of aspects to use in charts) was
disabled, though the program does not complain if it finds it, for
backward compatibility. The corresponding editing box in the
Windows interface was removed.<br>
<br>
Created new switch:<br>
-YAR &lt;asp1&gt; &lt;asp2&gt; &lt;flag1&gt;..&lt;flag2&gt;: Aspect
restrictions for range.<br>
<br>
Fixed old bug whereby Vertex was sometimes 180 degrees off for
tropical latitudes.<br>
<br>
True obliquity calculated by Swiss Ephemeris is now used instead of
mean obliquity calculated by the Matrix routines. Seconds of
obliquity are now displayed on the info bar with four decimal
places.<br>
<br>
Fixed bug whereby in the Arabic Parts list, a conjunction was shown
between the Part of Fortune and itself.<br>
<br>
Added French User's Guide created by Philippe Epaud. Added a call
to it in the Help Menu in the French version.<br>
<br>
Added a call to the French ReadMe file (lisezmoi.html) to
Astrolog.<br>
<br>
Added configuration for inversion of Arabic parts and dispositor's
glyph on the zodiac to the Chart Settings dialogue box.<br>
<br>
Changed the way true/mean node, and osculating/mean Lilith are
saved in the configuration file. This change is cosmetic, and has
no impact on functionality.<br>
<br>
Modified Aspects dialogue box: Removed Toggle button as some people
don't know what toggle means. Positive logic is now used to select
aspects - if ticked it is selected. Values for orb reductions for
parallel and comparison charts are now entered in percentage.<br>
<br>
Modified Object and Star Restrictions dialogue box: Positive logic
is now used to select an object - if ticked it is selected. This
change was made only to the Windows interface, internally and in
the switches Astrolog still operates with "restrictions".<br>
<br>
Removed from the Windows interface and keyboard shortcuts the
commands Include Minors, Include Uranians and Include Cusps,
because they were unnecessary and their purpose was not clear. The
switches '-C' and '-u' to include cusps and Uranians are now
inactive.<br>
<br>
Modified the default restrictions, to make them work with the
changes above.<br>
<br>
Removed Scribble Colour from the Settings menu, and added it to the
Colour Settings dialogue box.<br>
<br>
Previously the Help\Objects function would only show unrestricted
objects. This was changed, now help is displayed on all objects
defined in the program. Also corrected alignment problems.<br>
<br>
Added a link to French atlas at AstroDienst.<br>
<br>
Fixed old bug where Poseidon and Proserpina were swapped in the
Cusps and Minors dialogue box.<br>
<br>
Fixed bug whereby Lilith was being shown for heliocentric charts
(it shouldn't).<br>
<br>
Made several changes to the functions that print an aspect
list:<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixed old bug whereby, depending on
configuration settings, the most powerful aspects would not be
shown.<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Streamlined the sorting algorithm.<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved precision of power
calculations.<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modified function so that all aspects
are shown when sorting by power.<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved display of aspects.<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added option to sort aspects by orb.
This option can be configured with switch YSo, and is saved in the
configuration file.<br>
<br>
Created new entries in the View menu to set the type of sort, and a
new keyboard shortcut (Control-x).<br>
<br>
Improved the function that lists transits by influence: returns are
now flagged as "Return" instead of just an "R", added table header,
increased field width for planet name displays, abbreviated the
indication for applying or separating aspects, added sorting by
orb, added display according to applying/separating switch.<br>
<br>
Modified the Charts menu: the setting for Sidereal/Tropical is now
shown with separate menu items, with a bullet showing the current
choice.<br>
<br>
Replaced the check mark with a bullet in the House System menu.
Fixed old bug with check mark.<br>
<br>
Moved setting for applying/separating aspects from the View menu to
the Aspects dialogue box. Moved setting for aspect summary from the
Charts Settings dialogue box to the Aspects dialogue box.<br>
<br>
Moved "Chart for now" from Edit menu to Charts menu.<br>
<br>
Moved Tropical/Sidereal, House Systems and House Settings from
Charts menu to Settings menu.<br>
<br>
Moved Edit Configuration file from File menu to Edit menu.<br>
<br>
Moved all relationships charts to the main Charts menu, as it is
important to know when or not relationship mode is on (with the
bullet) - it prevents the display of other charts.<br>
<br>
Deleted dialog box to enter charts 3 and 4. Moved setting of tri
and quad wheel to Charts menu, moved opening of charts 3 and 4 to
File menu, and created two new entries in Edit menu to edit charts
3 and 4. Renamed the "Previous" button inside the Edit Chart Data
dialogue box as "Recall Chart data from memory". The functionality
is exactly the same, only the label was changed to better represent
what it actually does.<br>
<br>
Moved calendar into Graphics menu. Renamed Graphics menu as Extra.
Moved Save Chart Info and Recall Chart Info from Animation menu to
Edit menu. Moved Add Aspect Info from Graphics menu to View
Menu.<br>
<br>
Created in Lists menu an entry for Influence chart. Choosing this
entry puts Astrolog in text mode. Renamed Influence entry in Charts
menu as Dispositors. Choosing this entry puts Astrolog in graphics
mode. Keyboard shortcut 'v' toggles between the two chart types, as
before.<br>
<br>
Modified the Heliocentric command in Charts Menu, so that it does
exactly what it says, that is, puts Astrolog in heliocentric mode
if it is not, otherwise, the mode becomes geocentric. The check
mark also reflects the fact that is heliocentric. Moved
Heliocentric to Settings menu.<br>
<br>
Created two menu entries for setting graphics or text mode in View
menu. Current state is indicated by a bullet. Moved Parallel
aspects from View to Settings menu. Moved setting of Mean Node from
Obscure to Calculations dialogue box. Move Smart aspects, power to
be solid and parallel power from Obscure to Aspects dialogue box.
Parallel power is now entered as percentage.<br>
<br>
Improved dialogue control to enter data: the full month name is
shown, instead of just three characters as before, and the choice
of years goes from 2004-2010 instead of 1990-1999.<br>
<br>
Renamed Obscure dialogue box as Miscellaneous. Moved glyph settings
from Obscure to Graphics dialogue box. Created new dialogue box for
Arabic Parts Settings. Moved settings for Display format and Text
columns from Calculations to Chart Settings dialogue box.<br>
<br>
Added checkmarks to the majority of commands in Charts and Lists
menus, so that the current choice can be seen.<br>
<br>
Added new function to show the internal program status, to help
development and debugging, accessible from the Help menu. This
function is not intended for general users.<br>
<br>
The name of the default location can now be chosen in the Default
Info dialogue box. Added new command "-zn" to set the name of the
default location, which is saved in the configuration file.<br>
<br>
The Now button in the Transits dialogue box was renamed Here and
Now. It does the same as before, setting the time to now and
location to default, and in addition, now sets the location name to
default.&nbsp; The chart name is left unchanged. Exactly the same
was done in the Progressions and Chart Data dialogue boxes.<br>
<br>
Changed the way the switch "-n" is implemented, as well as Here and
Now in Charts menu, and other related commands. Previously the
person's name and location name were being erased, now the name
remains unchanged, and the location is set to the default location.
The rest of the functionality is unchanged, namely the latitude,
longitude, time zone and DST are set to default, and time and date
are set for now.<br>
<br>
Changed the longitude and latitude fields in Chart Data and Default
Info dialogue boxes from combo box to edit field, as it makes more
sense.<br>
<br>
Removed macro SWISS_EPHEMERIS from Astrolog32. It didn't make sense
anymore since the intent is to use Swiss Ephemeris to a greater
extent, and eventually remove most of the Matrix functions.<br>
<br>
Ayanamsha is now displayed in the info bar as a positive number for
the current time (previously it was negative). This is in agreement
with Swiss Ephemeris as well as astrological literature. Also
ayanamsha is displayed now with three decimal digits for seconds.
Note that for years before around 210 AC (using Fagan/Bradley),
Swiss Ephemeris returns a ayanamsha of 359 degrees, while Astrolog
shows -1. This behaviour has not been changed. Also note that
included in this ayanamsha as displayed, is the value of the zodiac
offset. This is the same as before.<br>
<br>
Swiss Ephemeris is now used to calculate ayanamsha. A new type of
sidereal mode was created. It can be set by the switch "-sm mode",
where mode is a mandatory parameter per Swiss Ephemeris, from 1 for
Fagan-Bradley through 17 for Galactic Centre at 0 Sagittarius. This
mode can also be set in the Calculations Settings dialogue box, and
is saved in the configuration file.<br>
<br>
The Zodiac Offset, which before was used in both tropical and
sidereal charts, will now be used only in sidereal. In the
calculations dialogue box, this offset is now displayed in a edit
box (previously it was displayed in a combo box with menu). The
reason is that the old menu is not necessary anymore.<br>
<br>
Removed almost all Windows menu shortcuts (those that appear in the
menus as an underscore letter), because many of them were not
working, as they were conflicting with Astrolog own shortcuts. Left
only the few shortcuts on the top level menu that were still
working, such as ALT-F for File, etc. Also from a developer's point
of view it is a nightmare to work with two different sets of
shortcuts, too much trouble for two little benefit. Astrolog own
shortcuts have not been touched.<br>
<br>
Many changes were done to directories in Astrolog32. Previously,
when Astrolog32 looked for a file (configuration file, ephemeris
file, chart files specified with the "-i" command, fixed stars
catalogue, documentation files, URLs) it searched for it in five to
seven directories: the current directory, three directories
specified with environment variables plus version number, and one
to three directories specified at compile time, which in the
release version was c:\astrolog (it may search c:\astrolog three
times).<br>
<br>
With the new changes, Astrolog32 will look for files in three
directories only, in this order:<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current drive and directory;<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drive and directory where astrolog32.exe is
(which may or may not be the same as the current drive and
directory);<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a directory that depends on the type of file
Astrolog32 is looking for, as detailed below;<br>
<br>
These are the rules for an automatic search for reading from a
file,&nbsp; however the default path to write to a file, defined in
the Windows file selection dialogue box, will be one of the
directories defined below accordingly to the file type.<br>
<br>
The following directories have been defined, and the files stored
in each directory are shown:<br>
<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main - Astrolog32.exe, astrolog32.dat,
icons, URLs, documentation files, fixed stars catalogue.<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ephemeris - This directory will store
Swiss Ephemeris files. Note that while a list of search directories
is passed by Astolog32 to Swiss Ephemeris, Swiss Ephemeris has its
own file search routine. For example, one of the places it looks
for is the directory specified by the environment variable
SE_EPHE_PATH. This is the current behaviour and will not be
changed, as Astolog32 (currently) uses Swiss Ephemeris in its
unchanged form.<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charts - Charts and planet position
files.<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interpretations - Interpretation files
(pl01.dat, house10.dat, etc).<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Miscellaneous - Miscellaneous files,
such as chart saved as text, bitmap, Windows Meta File, or
Postscript. Command files also go here.<br>
&#183;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American Atlas, International Atlas -
Atlas files.<br>
<br>
The environment variables ASTR and ASTROLOG are not used anymore
for searching directories. All the directories defined above are
configurable, and saved in the configuration file. This also
implies that the configuration file (astrolog32.dat) will have to
be in the current directory or in the directory where
astrolog32.exe is, in order for Astrolog32 to find it.<br>
<br>
When the program starts, if the configuration file cannot be found,
a dialogue box is presented to the user, inviting him or her to do
some initial configuration of the program. There are three buttons
that will call the Regional Settings, the Directories and Default
Location dialogue boxes.<br>
<br>
Made other changes to the way files are handled by Astrolog32 to
enhance usability. Improved filters when selecting a file for
reading and writing. An initial directory is always initialised
according to the file type. The file name itself is initialised for
chart files with the person's name plus extension ".dat" - this
saves typing. Position files are initialised with the person's name
plus "_pos.dat".<br>
<br>
Created a new command "-ic" to read a generic command file. This is
the same as "-i", the only difference being that the former looks
for a file in the miscellaneous directory, while the latter looks
for it in the charts directory.<br>
<br>
Removed from Astrolog32 the capability of reading and writing chart
files and planet positions in old format, meaning format up to and
including version 4.10. It is unlikely anybody is still using those
files.<br>
<br>
Removed from Astrolog32 the capability of not choosing Swiss
Ephemeris in the Calculations Settings dialogue box and through the
switch "-b", in other words, Swiss Ephemeris is now permanently
enabled. The reason is that the long term plan is to tie Astrolog32
tighter to Swiss Ephemeris, and replace Matrix routines by Swiss
Ephemeris routines.<br>
<br>
Added capability of switching between charts 1 and 2. This can be
accessed from the Edit menu or through the keyboard shortcut
"X".<br>
<br>
Fixed bug whereby in commands -pn and -p0n to do progressions,
timezone and DST were not being set to default, as they should.<br>
<br>
Turned SetCI from a macro to a function, and added an extra
parameter, location name, so that it does not get lost when the
rest of the parameters get copied.<br>
<br>
Removed "YX" switch from configuration file as it was not being
used in the program anymore. Removed several functions that were
not being used, for example, to input data. Created several new
functions to handle chart information, to improve modularity.<br>
<br>
Added macro 40 to Run menu, however no shortcut is defined for it.
The corresponding shortcut (ALT F4) is used by Windows to close the
main window. Removed shortcut for macro 42 (ALT F6), because it was
not working. Added 72 new macros, for a grand total of 120, divided
in six menus of 20 each. The new macros don't have shortcuts.<br>
<br>
Renamed Zodiac Offset as Sidereal Correction, as that better
reflects how it is now used. In the Calculations menu grouped this
correction with the sidereal mode. On the info bar the sidereal
selected mode is now displayed below the indication of sidereal
chart (if enabled), immediately followed by the ayanamsha.<br>
<br>
Fixed old bug whereby the Warnings message box was being displayed
with the Error icon, and the Error message box was being displayed
with the Warnings icon.<br>
<br>
Moved list of changes from a text file to a HTML
file.<br>

version
1.20 (23 April 2005)</big><br>
</big>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<big>Fixed old bug whereby edit fields were being used in the
Aspects and Stars dialogue boxes to show the names of aspects and
stars. This resulted in a different colour being shown on Windows
XP.<br>
<br>
A double click inside the sidereal mode list box in the
Calculations Settings dialogue box is now equivalent to selecting
the clicked mode followed by clicking OK.<br>
<br>
Added International Atlas for 246 countries and territories with
2.86 million places.<br>
<br>
Modified function SetEditMDYT used in several dialogue boxes, for
example Enter Chart Data. The dropdown list for years now goes from
1920 - 2020, the list for hours goes from 0-23, and the list for
days of the month from 1-31.<br>
<br>
Enter Chart Data dialogue box: improved tab selection order, and
increased size of dropdown boxes.<br>
<br>
Default Info dialogue box: improved tab selection order, increased
size of dropdown boxes, and in French version replaced combo box
with edit box for longitude and latitude (English version already
had edit box).<br>
<br>
Calculations Settings dialogue box: the sidereal mode is now
displayed in alphabetical order, as opposed to the numerical order
in Swiss Ephemeris definitions, as it used to be.<br>
<br>
Added American Atlas with 0.97 million names for 60 states and
territories. The total atlas (International + American) has now
3.83 million names.<br>
<br>
Added to Graphics Settings dialogue box the capability to configure
the decoration to the graphics display corners. The configuration
is saved, and the switch used is YXC &lt;type&gt;&lt;size&gt;
&lt;no. lines&gt;. Type is 0 (none), 1 (moir&#233;) or 2 (web).
Size has the range 1-100, and number of lines refers to the lines
used for the spider web, with range 1-500, and must be used even if
the type is moir&#233;. The colour of the decoration is set in
the Colour Settings dialogue box, and is also saved with switch
Ykc. The corner decoration already existed in 5.40, but was an hack
that most people did not know about, and was only partly
configurable.<br>
<br>
Moved the first group of 20 macros from a sub-menu to the main Run
menu, for easier access.<br>
<br>
Moved all functions that process switches into a new file,
&#8220;process_switches.c&#8221;.<br>
<br>
Changed the About dialogue box, putting the credits inside a
scrollable box, as it looks better and is more modern. Eliminated
function that displayed credits in text mode, as it is redundant in
a Window software (the same functionality is provided in the About
box). Improved credits list.<br>
<br>
The Display Format radio buttons in the Charts Settings dialogue
box now control not only the display of longitude as before, but
also the display of latitude. The same is true to the switches
&#8220;-s[z,h,d]: Display locations as in zodiac, hours/minutes, or
degrees.&#8221;. As before the Print Seconds setting impacts the
precision of the display.<br>
<br>
Proserpina is now calculated with Swiss Ephemeris if the file
&#8220;seorbel.txt&#8221; is found and has correct data. This file
should be stored in the &#8220;main&#8221; directory (or
&#8220;principal&#8221; in the French version). If this file is not
found, the Matrix routines are used as before.<br>
<br>
Added a temporary feature, planet positions for a second chart data
are displayed on the info bar. This is available only for some
types of relationship charts, such as synastry, transits, etc. This
feature is not configurable and is disabled by default. To turn it
on, press the &#8216;=&#8217; key.<br>
<br>
The Swiss Ephemeris version 1.67 is used now (it was 1.66).<br>
<br>
Fixed a bug when reading chart position files, whereby some planets
had wrong positions read.<br>
<br>
Modified the chart info structure. Name and location are now arrays
of characters as opposed to pointers to characters. This is to fix
old memory leaks, plus as a preparation for future additions to
this structure. Also added &#8220;next&#8221; and
&#8220;previous&#8221; fields. These have only local significance,
and can be used in linked lists.<br>
<br>
Made some changes in the way planet positions are calculated with
Swiss Ephemeris. This was necessary to implement chart search
feature, and also as preparation for future removal of Matrix
routines.<br>
<br>
Added a chart search feature. It can be accessed from the File menu
or the shortcut ALT-s. Its default search is to find all chart
files in the charts directory. This search can be restricted in
three ways: charts with a string in part of the name, with a planet
in sign (considering the configured sidereal or tropical mode), or
with two planets in aspect (considering the configured orbs,
including additions, but excluding special orbs for relationship or
parallel charts).<br>
<br>
Note that the search restrictions are cumulative, that is, if the
three searches are ticked, the only charts shown are those that
satisfy all the three requirements. The OK button, as well as
double-clicking a name on the chart list, opens the selected chart.
This feature can also be used as an alternative to Open Main Chart
off the file menu, to more quickly find a chart, especially when
there are many charts in one file. Also note that searches
involving planets can be done only in geocentric or heliocentric
modes.<br>
<br>
The feature &#8220;Copy chart as WMF&#8221; was removed from the
Edit menu. In fact this feature did not work in 5.40, 5.41g or
Astrolog32. The corresponding function will be left in the code,
where it has been incomplete for a long time.</big><big><br>
