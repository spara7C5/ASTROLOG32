Astrolog32 <a href="#FAQ"><b>about</b></a> will usually launch without fail with an 'Here and Now' chart. It uses the 'here' you chose in the set-up if that went successfully, and the computer base-time, adjusted for time-zone as you chose in your installation dialogs, and perhaps, plus a Daylight Saving addition.<br>You can launch as many instances of Astrolog32 running simultaneously as your memory, (and your computer's), can handle, and it's normal to do this to compare two or more charts, as an alternative to the multiwheel mode.. with two or more instances of the program, each copy of Astrolog32 can be a different colour, or chart, or set to a different harmonic.<p>
You'll see that Astrolog32 bucks modern trends: there's no 'Back' button, nor 'Undo'. There's no &quot;File&quot; - &quot;New&quot;; Astrolog32 makes a data-window to fill in by going [Edit] > [Edit chart data]. 'Other methods apply' for Astrolog32, where Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v, Ctrl+x do not work to copy or paste images or text (they work in the dialog boxes though): even Ctrl+s won't open a save dialog! .. <f8>For these commands, the <b>[Edit]</b> and <b>[File]</b> menus, or Astrolog32's unique keyboard calls, do the file-handling.</f8><p>
<blockquote>THERE ARE FIVE WAYS OF INTERFACING WITH THE PROGRAM:<p><img src="companion_files/astrlog_66perc.png" width="20" height="20" alt="" title="" border="0" align="left" />&nbsp;1.

<img src="companion_files/Foldersn.gif" width="140" height="176" alt="" title="A32 folder tree" border="0" align="right" />
<b>Astrolog32 is modular</b>, but just the unzipped <f1>\main</f1> folder will allow you to view any contemporary charts in Astrolog's '<f1>.dat</f1>' format, without even downloading Atlases or Ephemerides. All or some additional contents can be unzipped to 'Astrolog32''s internal folders from the internet, or indeed expanded folders can be copy/pasted into it from another person's installation. <b>With all the Atlases incorporated</b>, you won't need to google for a place's co-ordinates (<a href="#ob"><b>how-to</b></a>); and <b>with additional Ephemeris files incorporated</b>, you can chart back to 12000BCE! (<a href="#ep"><b>how-to</b></a>). <i>In the 'V2.0x' releases, a folder of six modules with basic content is created and an uninstaller are included.</i><p>

'Astrolog32' is the preferred name for the containing folder, though even here you can diverge, if you edit the folder-path in all the Config.file's 'DIRECTORIES' lines, using the new name.<p> ~ and regarding the best location for your Astrolog32, convenience may as well be your guide, as long as you have the admin privileges to browse to the folder. 'Program Files' is now 'offered', but Windows doesn't care; Windows doesn't know! ~ but if you choose 'Program Files' with versions V1.30 and before, then as that is not its expected <b>default</b> location 'C:', you'll have to correct the folders' paths in the Config.file to match where you've put it. <b>See <a href="#dir">'YOUR DEFAULT DIRECTORIES for FOLDERS'</a> in CUSTOMIZING DEFAULTS...</b>. If you are a beginner, stick with 'Program Files', for V2.0x versions.
<br clear="right"><p>
<b>Changing your settings</b>: The default settings (colour, size, house system etc) define what you get at launch; immediately your session has begun, you can change these, on a per-session basis through the menus or switches, and the changes you make will stay for the whole of the live session: those changes you make will continue for all subsequent charts during the session - unless you un-make those changes - <b>but the defaults will re-appear at re-launch.</b><p>However, if you <b>save the Config.file (<f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>) anytime after</b> your changes via menus or switches, you'll find many - not all - then become your new set-up, after a re-launch. <b>(See <a href="#Setup">CHANGING YOUR SET-UP</a>, below.)</b>

<p><!-- Set this is a color block -->  <b>BEFORE YOU DIVE IN</b>: Three things you should know:<p>
<img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" />
Astrolog does NOT prompt you to save any chart!<p><img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" /> Also, all chartfiles, when saved, go by default into the <f1>\astrolog32\charts</f1> folder, so uninstalling the program folder will mean you delete all your chart-data as well, unless you've backed up.<p>

<img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" />
 Printing in Astrolog32 <i>(versions up to v.1.38)</i> contains a major pitfall for newbies, where you are using a black or dark background for the graphical chart, because what you see is what you get. Many beginners have wasted a black ink cartridge on their first print. So use the option to 'Reverse Background' before you print - simply type 'x' on the keyboard, anytime, to invert colours!<p>

<blockquote>
Astrolog32 customarily opens a chosen chart after you've browsed to its <f1>.dat</f1> file via <b>[File] > [Open Main Chart]</b>, or Alt+o, or you can go <b>[File] > [Open Chart #2]</b>, or Alt+shift+O; two different keyboard shortcuts (BTW, not zero! that's O for orange). &nbsp; These will load the Mainchart thread or Chart #2 thread, respectively, when you browse to a chart and click 'Open'  - go shift+X to see chart #2. (For charts #3, #4, it's menu only to load them).<p>
Any charts in your <f1>\charts</f1> folder are shown alphabetically: clicking 'View Menu' icon, then 'Details' allows you to roster the charts in another order (date; format).<br>
Navigate to the chart you want, and go 'OK'; and chart <f1><i>xxx</i>.dat</f1> appears.<p>

<p>It's according to the Config.file (<f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>) whether your default view is text, or chartwheel, and, with a new install, it's by default a chartwheel - type a 'v' to reverse to text.<p>
Where's chart #2? - see <a href="#x"><b>chart #2</b></a>, below.<p>

(Charts in batches can be opened serially, as a result of Astrolog32's <b>[File] > [Search charts]</b> operation, after a selection of charts have been filtered and listed by the search engine.)<p>
ANOTHER WAY: where you have filenames shorter than 8 characters, these can be opened quicker by command-line: typing <f2>-i(space)<i>filename</i>.dat</f2> will raise <f1><i>filename.</i>dat</f1>.
</blockquote>
<div align="center">--------------------- --------------------</div><blockquote><p>
From the data it then holds in memory, Astrolog32 can make a Tropical chart, or a Sidereal chart, or a chart centred on any planet [bar Moon], or any or all of the other displayable options (like bi-wheels, tri-wheels, quadriwheels, composite wheels when chart-threads  #2, <i>#3, #4</i> are filled in). Allied aspectarians, harmonics, or object-data lists for any Main chart or combined chart can be called up.<p>
<!--  how about the images here?  -->
More data still is instantly available: it only requires that, say, you de-restrict Fixed Stars, or add more Minors, and your changes are added at once (Go <b>[Settings]</b> menu for these...)</blockquote><p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" /> Astrolog's chartfiles are not locked, though they may be set 'Read Only'; so any <f1>.dat</f1> can be modified, and creating new charts often means serially over-writing the current chart's data....<p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" width="16" height="16" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" /> Unless you have unzipped the Celebs' Charts into your <f1>\charts</f1> folder, then after an first install, there's nothing in <f1>\charts</f1>, though in version 2.04 you will find John Lennon's chart.
<hr align="center" width="100%" size="3" noshade color="#F08080" /><p>

<b><font size=4>Finding a chart</font></b><p><blockquote>
If you have charts in the <f1>\charts</f1> folder, you find them by going <b>[File] > [Open mainchart]</b>, or <b>[File] > [Open chart 2]</b>. If you have a text-file saved, don't use astrolog32, open Notepad, and navigate to <f1>\miscellaneous</f1>.<br>
<p>
<font size=4>Astrolog32's 'Search Charts' filter.</font></b><p>
<b>[File] > [Search Charts]</b> is a small but still very useful set of filters, selecting up to five definers for a search of the charts:<ul><li>a part of the filename:</li><li>any one luminary, planet or any object, filtered by Zodiacal sign, so if you remember the Sun sign, but not the name, you can filter for that</li><li>particular aspect between any two luminaries, planets, Node, East or West Point</li><li>one luminary, planet or any object filtered by its House</li><li>one luminary, planet or any object in a chosen Gauquelin sector</li></ul>'Alt+s' is the keyboard switch to call this Search feature.<blockquote>
<b>Note 1.</b> there is no filter for year - unless you inserted the year in the file-name, when you saved it; then you could put it in the 'search for'...'in name' field.<p><b>Note 2.</b> If you click 'Search', with 'subfolders' ticked, but none of the filter-lines, 'Search charts' will supply all the charts in your <f1>\charts</f1> folder, in alphabetical order.</blockquote>
When the hourglass vanishes, any results appearing in the box on the right can be opened with a double-click, or otherwise, starting with the first alphabetically by clicking the 'OK' button. </blockquote><img src="companion_files/sbg2a.gif" title="click Search button to start a search" hspace="8" align="right"><blockquote> They can then be modified, and then re-saved.<br>You can then move on to the next, or previous, of the listed charts, if you want to, or even interrupt your search to make a new chart, and then pick up the searched returns again.<p>
To go to the next: exclusively when you have called a search up, the options <b>[File] > [Open previous chart]</b> (Ctrl+r) and <b>[File] > [Open next chart]</b> (Ctrl+n) will work to scroll through your searched charts, in sequence, to the first or last of the list that <b>[File] > [Search charts]</b> has provided.
</blockquote><p>
<b>NOTE</b>: Look out for three catches:<blockquote><img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" /> that you must tick the tickbox to the left of each filter-line you're using; <p><img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" /> secondly, when the query dialog box is been filled in, you must click 'Search', not 'OK';<p><img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" /> thirdly, you may need to tick the tickbox for 'Search subfolders'.</blockquote>You can select a particular subfolder - click the ['..'] box, - <b>IMO, this navigation is impossibly lengthy!</b>. Pasting the extended path into the &quot;Search Directory&quot; address field is quicker - and as, in addition, I wanted the paths available from <i>within</i> Astrolog32 - clearly I had to hijack a <b>[Help]</b> text:<p><div align="right"><b>DODGE No. 1</b> <img src="companion_files/phkyh2b.gif" width="284" height="23" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" /></div><br>Here, I've chosen the <img src="companion_files/readme62.JPG" alt="" title="modified Readme file" border="0" align= "right" />
<f1>Readme.html</f1> that is in <f1>\main</f1>, and normally opens from <b>[Help]</b>. After unticking the 'read only' attribute in its file properties, I opened it in Notepad, and added there the paths to various <f1>\charts</f1> subfolders., inserting them after the final 'DISCLAIMER' paragraph.<br><i>Put a <, then a </i>p<i>, then another >, at the start of each line.</i> &nbsp; Remember to pick 'All files', when saving <b>Readme.html</b> from Notepad - or <i>.txt</i> will be added as a new suffix!<p><f1>Readme.html</f1> opens in your browser, and in that window, you only need to highlight and copy a path from the Readme file, and paste it into the 'Search Directory' address field, and proceed as normal.<p>Another route, you could insert the paths at the start of <f1>Readme.txt</f1>, but it's a bigger file for your pc memory to host.<br clear="right">

<a name="#qq"><b><font size="4">Choosing good filenames</font></b></a>

<blockquote>
<p>In Astrolog32, there are file-names saved<i> within </i>the file-content, and file-names that you save with, into the <f1>\charts</f1> folder; often the two are the same, but they don't have to be, and they can serve different functions.
<p>
Any searches for any part of a name which you typed <b>only</b> in the 'Edit' dialog Name-field will be found in an Astrolog32 Search. It's the opposite with Windows "Search For Files and Folders", - such data is <i>within</i> the file, and Windows will not search<i> within</i> <f1>.dat</f1> files as if they were text; with Windows, <b>only the [File] > [Save Mainchart data] names, that is the <i>saving</i> filenames which will be searched for and found</b>.<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Let's call these two the 'saving' name and the 'covert' name</i>.<p>
For this reason, the name which you <b>save</b> a chart by (as opposed to the covert 'Name' field in the 'Edit' dialog), should be the one which holds any key information for <i>a Windows search</i>, and, to be easily served up by Astrolog's <b>[File] > [Open Main Chart]</b>: e.g.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<f1>Doe,John_1865_family,horse doctor,Ohio,unrect.dat</f1><p><br>

Astrolog32's <b>[File] > [Search Charts..]</b> module only inspects the 'covert' names; as, after rummaging through <f1>\charts</f1> folder, Astrolog32 can only present charts in alphabetic order, showing only a little of the name, then putting <i>surnames</i> first, may help you find people quickly; putting <i>dates</i> first means you may find dates of chart-erection, or particular events, quickly.<p>
<p></blockquote> <a href="#Menu"><img src="companion_files/arrow_up1.png" width="18" height="18" alt="Return" title="Return to MENU" border="0" align="right" /></a>

<p>

<b><font size=4>Entering data</font><p><blockquote>[Edit] > [Edit Main chart data ..]</b> is the menu-route to creating a new chart, modifying the 'Here-and-Now' chart seen at your launch; or else, it's the route to re-opening a chart, in order to amend or rectify it: after the ten fields are filled in as you require, and 'OK' is clicked, this will be the datum that Astrolog retains, to show, to save, or create all the other viewable options for your new Mainchart.<br>The keyboard shortcut to edit the current chart, or create a new chart, is Alt+z.<p>
You only need to type the first three letters of the month in the first field, and after that 'tab' key carries you through the fields in order. At 'Time', 'Daylight Saving' and 'TimeZone', the down arrow-key spins through the options;
<i>or you can put the last three fields in manually - it's maybe quicker.</i>
<!-- put an image in here -->
<p>After selecting the timezone, click 'Call Atlas' for giving Astrolog32 the location, (about, see <b><a href="#Atlas">THE ATLASES</a></b>); then, location <b>and</b> co-ordinates are automatically filled in, (though you can insert them manually).<p>Click <b>OK</b>!<p>This new 'Main Chart' you see is on chart-thread #1, - this is the principal working chart-thread, seen, and doing the bulk of the work where there's no call for accompanying charts in Relationship Mode, and as well, the only one that can be copied or saved.<p>When you fill <b>[Edit Mainchart Data]</b> again, and 'OK' new input, then the first Mainchart data will be dumped; whatever data-fields you don't change will carry over - so, unless you are careful, data from the previous chart you may find unmodified, in the new chart!!<br>&nbsp;And all the other chart-threads are editted similarly, - by overwriting the data through their respective editting dialog box.</blockquote></blockquote>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" />  Bear in mind that, where you don't modify the name-field during a new data-input, saving will perhaps overwrite a prior chart's name on your new chart<b>!</b><p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> In your charts, the time, timezone and global co-ordinates don't even have to correspond for a chart to appear - Astrolog doesn't know better than you! The sinking Titanic was timed in GMT, and as long as the given time and timezone match, that secures the instant in time - the location (mid-Atlantic in that case) is meanwhile derived from the co-ordinates.<p>
For a breakdown of the TimeZones available in the drop-down, and of the way you can insert a manual or preset correction from your local time, seek out <a href="#Time"><b>PART # 8</b></a>.<p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif"  /> No matter how big the ephemeris you got is, the drop-down for years in the 'Year' field will only offer the years from 1920 onwards, to click on; for any other years your ephemerides cover, they must be typed in. (To print off text ephemerides, see 'text mode', the third section following <b>Chart #2</b>, in <b><a href="#Menu">TOPICS MENU</a> / BASICS # 1</b>)<p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif"  /> For BCE, put a minus before the year.<p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> Astrolog automatically uses the Julian calendar for dates before October 15, 1582, and automatically uses the Gregorian calendar for dates after October 4, 1582.
For dates in countries when they were still keeping Julian after (<i>U.K., American colon. subject to Britain, Netherlands, Russia..</i>), the difference in days must be reckoned - see <a href="#Calend"><b>Julian to Gregorian</b></a> section.<p>

If the charts you make are usually close to the present date as well as confined to your DST zone, as in Europe, - then toggle the little 'Summertime' switch you'll find in <b>[Edit] > [Set Default Location, Timezone..]</b> (Alt+shift+D opens the same dialog; ~ the 'down' arrow does this; &nbsp; then go <b>[File] > [Save current settings]</b>.<br>DST will then be applied to <b>all charts</b>  <i>after you re-launch</i>, and in the <b>[Edit] > [Edit chart #x]</b> Summer Time field, it will show 'Yes', and Astrolog sets the charts for an hour earlier than your time-datum.<p><img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" /> On the down-side, you will notice there's scarcely a change visible in the sidebar - it says 'DT' instead of 'ST' (standard time) - and you need to be sharp on the look-out for a possibly-wrong time setting when erecting a <i>non-DST</i> chart, so as to pick up on any mismatch between what you see and what you intend.<br><p>

If you make worldwide charts as well as domestic and 'Here &amp; Now's, you could deploy two Astrolog32 installations, one for current events during your DST summer, but the other permanently at your <i>standard</i> time, (I've suggested this, for other reasons, elsewhere in the Companion); my two versions have to look quite different, so I know which Astrolog version I'm in.<p>To do this yourself, see the very last article in this guide.<br></blockquote>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> There is going to be <b>no prompt</b> to reset DST at summer-time's start or end, - Astrolog32 is very <b>manual!</b> - &nbsp; 
set yourself a pc-diary or e-mail alert now, for when Summer-Time ends or starts.

This feature does not overwrite charts #2, #3, #4. <b>Note</b>: there is a little tickbox top left ('Do Progression') in the 'Progressions' dialog box, - this must be ticked.<br>Getting out of your progressed chart to the Radical again: open the 'Progressions' dialog  box again - where you'll see the data you entered is still resident - uncheck the 'Do Progression' tickbox and 'OK' it.

<p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> This progressed chart does not disclose the 'day/hour equivalent' from the natum, for the year and fortnight progressed to in a secondary progression.
<p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> If you open a <i>new</i> Mainchart, it too will be progressed to the same point in time, unless you kill the progression, by going <b>[Charts] > [Progressed (single wheel)]</b>, or Alt+shift+P, and un-ticking the 'Do Progression' box.
<p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> If you exchange Chart #1 and Chart #2, at this point, the progression <b>will be dumped</b>.<p>

<b>An alternative way</b>: Secondary Progression is simply achieved by using <b>[Animation] > [Animate]</b>, or the shortcut, the key 'p' (without the quotes), which also sets off forward progression by days until 'p' is pressed again. Letter 'r' puts this progression in reverse until 'r' is pressed again, so these shortcuts, p and r, are toggles.
<br>To do this, though, it is first necessary to reckon days/hours from the start-date, and count each step.<p>Steps of time depend on the <b>[Animation] > [Jump Factor]</b>, which you can alter through the menu, (or by switch; see the <b><a href="companion_files/kswitches4.html" target="blank">TABLES OF KEYBOARD SWITCHES</a></b> for details), even while progression is running.

<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: Progression works just as well in all text mode charts, and in Local Horizon, maps and Dispositor pages as well. For all branches of astrology, this makes scanning for an exact time easy.<br><p>

<p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> In a bi-wheel, the Main chart appears as an inner ring, within #2 chart: curiously, in text mode, the data for chart #2 appears, but not of the Main chart - this is the only way I know of getting quickly to the chart #2 text-data in isolation.
<p>
<div align=center>-------------------------------------------</div>In fact, you can only save, or see in isolation, the Charts nos.#1 and #2 (and that's by swapping them via <b>[Edit] > [Exchange mainchart and #2]</b> - a recent, very useful adaptation). Charts #3 and #4 can <b>only</b> be viewed in the Multiwheel already containing positions of charts #1 and #2!<br>If you want to compare more than two charts, but want more control and less fuss, the difficulties mentioned with Multiwheel are an argument, maybe, for launching more instances of the program, and either using Alt+tab to view them alternately, or tile them.<p>

</f2>', (or, the files may end up broken!)<p>
Secondly, you can save more data by choosing to type in <i>different info</i>, when it comes to saving into the <f1>\charts</f1> folder. Windows has a different allowance -  it will allow 140 characters maximum - but it depends on the length of the full address path to your <f1>\charts</f1> folder whether it displays correctly: if it's as long as the path to <f1>\My Documents</f1>, the names may be foreshortened, like this <f2>SHORTE~1.DAT.</f2>.<p>(See <a href="#qq"><b>Choosing good filenames</b></a>, above, for my conjectures on what a saved-name might usefully include..).

 The data you keyed in to the Mainchart can almost always be saved, whatever window you are at. So, if you find yourself lost in some window option, you haven't lost your chart-data .. just go <b>[File] > [Save Main chart data]</b>, or Alt+w. <b>The exception is, where you have progressed or regressed the chart</b>, the data you started with is lost.<p>

<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> The image of the chart or Aspectarian that gets saved there is of a size equivalent to what's onscreen, so resizing the Astrolog window resizes the image..<p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" />  While another native file-format, (<f1>_pos.dats</f1>), copes with derived charts, a <f1>.dat</f1> should be used for charts that have the Sun or planet other than Earth at its centre; though they will save as Earth-charts, <f1>.dats</f1> can be reset to another central planet; <f1>_pos.dats</f1> cannot be reset.<p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> Astrolog32 is liberal in accepting other file suffixes too: name your chart &quot;<f1>Xxxx.nat</f1>&quot;, and the program opens it without problem, though its <b>[Open Charts]</b> dialog box looks preferentially for <f1>.dat</f1> files. This does mean that you can have a second invisible cohort of files in a given folder.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I've tried &quot;<f1>.old</f1>&quot; and &quot;<f1>.hat</f1>&quot;, found them by choosing Files-of-Type: 'All Files', and opened them no problem!<br clear=right><p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> Astrolog signals any error in the naming by refusing to save, and not displaying other charts in the destination folder: Windows baulks at odd characters in the filename, which may be there even if you can't see them: as, for instance, if you paste in a name from a .doc or .rtf, which may include hidden formatting instructions (even line-breaks!).<br>Problems arise with <f2>/ \ : * ? !

<font size=4><b>Fixed Stars</b></font><p><blockquote>There are two modes for stars now, either:<br>
<ul><li> The Default: what Stars you get when going <b>[Settings] > [Include Fixed Stars.. ]</b> (or shift+U - a toggle) depends now on which, of them all, are actually aspecting planets at the time-datum; also, by default, Fixed Stars are always 'off', and so must first be toggled 'on'; (this option for viewing leaves <b>[Star Selections]</b>, and Alt+shift+R which opens this selection popup, redundant).</li><p>
<li>Old-Style, or Alternative: it used to be that a personal selection could be made at the start of each session, but just switching Fixed Stars <b>'on'</b> meant, if 'all' were selected, the whole roster of available stars used to appear in your chart, and it was a messy sight; on the other hand, if <b>[Settings] > [Star Selections]</b> were all <b>'off'</b> when you clicked <b>[Settings] > [Include Fixed Stars.. ]</b> (or, go shift+U), then this feature seemed not to work.<br>Now, it's: <b>[Settings] > [Star Selections]</b>  (Alt+shift+R) first, - select - and then the stars appear without more ado (this makes <b>[Settings] > [Include Fixed Stars..]</b> redundant.)</li></ul><br>
The latter option, which lets you keep track of your particular malefics or benefics, has quite a set-up then at the start of each session, - sadly a macro can't accomplish it, and the Config.file has no entry for it.<br>This has driven me to consider keepng my pc on standby, 24-7, so as not to re-make Star Selections.<p></blockquote>

<div align=center>-------------------------------------------</div><p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> The change back to the old-style delivery of Fixed Stars, from the modern-style, is available via the menus, the first checkbox in <b>[Settings] > [Chart Settings]</b> needs to be unchecked and 'OK'ed, then, to make it permanent, the Config.file (<f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>) must be saved <b>[File] > [Save current settings..]</b>, &amp; save the text-file called <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>.<p>
<img src="companion_files/fixstars1-57per.png" width="344" height="64" alt="" title="set alt view" hspace="8" border="0" align="left" /> Or, the Config.file itself should be opened, altered and saved (e.g.see left); find the line starting <f2>=YU</f2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; and, at the start, delete '<f2>=</f2>', and put an underscore instead.

A prime concern of Walter Pullen, Astrolog's deviser, was to make possible different models for grading the power of different objects and different aspects.<p>

To do this, users of Astrolog32 can apply power-numbers to each aspect, orb and object, either as in the past through amending the Config.file lines, or now, through these menus:<ul><li><b>[Settings] > [Minors]</b> or (Alt+j),</li><li><b>[Settings] > [Uranians]</b>, or (Alt+shift+J),</li><li><b>[Settings] > [Aspect Settings]</b>, or (Alt+shift+A).</li></ul>Higher numbers signify more power, on a scale from 0 to 50.<p>
The calculations are automated, then, and shown in <b>[Lists] > [Aspects]</b>, and inform the default interpretations. The closeness of orb is factored in.

<b>[View] > [Show border]</b> (b is the toggle): &nbsp; this hides, or shows, the border around the chart - you can't make this a default feature, except by altering <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>, making the colour parameters the same for lines and background.

  can do this month's transits by just typing "astrolog -M 10". Here's
  another example: Suppose you want a feature to bring up the chart of
  the spouse of whoever's chart you are viewing at any time. You can
  define a special macro, say in slot 5, in each of your chart info

<b>[Lists] > [Arabic parts]</b>
tells the program to serve the Arabic parts text-list. Alt+p is the shortcut. You can't make this a default feature. It is a tenacious page, sometimes won't quit..<p>
<b>[View] > [Sort aspects by power/orb]</b> (Ctrl+x is the toggle) re-sorts the aspects list (see <b>[Lists] > [aspects]</b>, Alt+l), accordingly.<p>
<b>[View] > [Show Aspect Info]</b>, (shift+I, a toggle), shows or hides a power calculation derived from the aspects in the chart. It is not a link to the Aspectarian. This only affects the graphic view. If you're in text-mode, this will flip Astrolog32 into graphics-mode, with the calculation added.<p>

Using the <b>[Extra]</b> sky maps and world maps, switching into <b>[Bonus]</b> mode (little i), transforms the rather humdrum-looking maps, (when CONSTELLATIONS are ON (shift+F)), into a planetarium! You can't make this a default feature.<br>

<b><font size="4">'Right-click &amp; Open' doesn't work, and what you might do about it.</b></font>:<blockquote>
<img src="companion_files\GEAROL-16c5.gif"> Even if you have <f1>astrolog32.exe</f1> as a right-mouse click option, <b>Astrolog32 won't open with the chart you've highlighted in a folder window, as other programs do.</b> You can only open &amp; alter .dat-files using Notepad, from your right-click options list; unless, that is, you want the ability to open <f1>.dat</f1> files with Astrolog32 enough to jump through hoops to obtain it; I am much endebted to Michael Rideout at 'Astrolog_List' forum, for explaining this dodge:<p>
<div align="right"><b>DODGE No. 4. <img src="companion_files/phkyh2b.gif" width="284" height="23" alt="" title="" border="0" align=""></b></div><br>If it weren't that Astrolog32 uses <f1>.dat</f1> files,  - an universal text-format used by Windows and countless other applications, this would be just a case of setting the executable <f1>astrolog32.exe</f1> as a right-click option, then altering the file-opening properties of all <f1>.dat</f1> files.<br>
It woud be rash to suggest such a radical action, because .dat files are used by <i>many other programs</i>: instead, this dodge entails using a new suffix, not .dat, then tweaking Windows to accept it.<p>You will have to save in future using the new suffix, while choosing "All Files" in the "File of Type" field, and <i>optionally, duplicate all your old Astrolog32 <f1>.dat</f1> files to a new folder, as a batch, and convert their file-extension to, say, <f1>.A32 </f1>- some unique suffix that Astrolog32 won't reject.<br>e.g. <f1>gabin_jean.A32</f1>.<br>After that, you can put them in <b>any</b> folder &amp; open them with a right-click &quot;Open with..&quot;!</i>
<p>
This is the procedure in <f8>Xp</f8>:<p>Decide on an unused file-extension, such as Michael's <f1> .A32</f1> ending (lists are available on the web of file-extensions already in use: and a convention is now, that extensions use capitals)<blockquote>
1.  create a duplicate of a <f1>.dat</f1> file, on your desktop, rename it <f1>yourchart.dat</f1>, and change the name to show the new file-extension (this example uses .A32)</blockquote>         
Next the executable:<blockquote>
2. Double-click '<f1>yourchart.A32</f1>', to try to open it - a dialog box appears ;<br>
3. Click 'Select program from a list', and click 'OK' ;<br>
4. Make sure the 'Always use the selected program to open this kind of file' tickbox is checked ;<br>
5. Click 'Browse..', and navigate into <f1>\main</f1> folder within Astrolog, and highlight the <f1>astrolog32.exe</f1> file there ;<br>
6.Click 'OK' ;<br>
7. Close Astrolog32! - it will have opened with an 'Here &amp; Now' chart ; <br>
</blockquote>Last, the new type of file's properties are altered:<p></blockquote><img src="companion_files/filetypes79perc.JPG" hspace="8" align="right"><blockquote><blockquote>
8. Open 'My Computer' ;<br>
9. On the menu, select <b>[Tools] > [Folder Options] </b>;<br>
10. Click 'File Types' ;<br>
11. Select 'A32', and click 'Advanced' ;<br>
12. Highlight 'Open..', then select 'Edit..' ;<br>
13. Put your cursor in the 'Application used to perform action' line, press 'end' key. Leave one space after <i><b>&quot;..olog32.exe&quot;</b></i>, adding <i><b>&quot;-i&quot;</b></i>, (with the quotes), &amp; leave another space before <i><b>&quot;%1&quot;</b></i>. (Image below) ;<br>
14. Save, and exit ;<br>
15. Double click on <f1>yourchart.A32</f1>, and it will open in the program.<br clear ="right">
</blockquote></blockquote><img src="companion_files/Open up.PNG" hspace="8" align="right">
<p>
The result is, that in any folder window, or in 'Recent Documents', or on the desktop, any <f1>.A32</f1> chart will now open in Astrolog32 from your right-click menu.<p>
If you elect to modify the file properties of <f1>.dat</f1> files, (which may alter a number of other applications, not to mention the operating system!), try it on a dedicated Astrolog32 pc first, and you would be rash not to back up your operating system first, before changing the file's attributes!<br clear="right"></blockquote><p>

<h3><a name="Setup">- CHANGING YOUR SET-UP.</a></h3><p>
This guide has now covered many alternative views available in Astrolog32, and how to adopt them through <b>[Settings]</b> menu, or switches; having tried out various in-session changes, and during the same session, you can make some of these changes appear <b>always at launch</b>: all you must do is <b>save</b> the Config.file (<f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>) - a link to do this is in <b>[File]</b> menu. &nbsp;&nbsp;Then relaunch.
<blockquote><i>For example, defaults at installation are: </i>blue background, Placidus houses, graphical chart, Tropical signs, .. and of course your default location,<i> .. yet it is a moment's work if you are an old hand, to change <b>four </b>of these permanently. (Changing default location takes a little time .. see below for how.)<p>

To set Astrolog32 to, say, Regiomontanus houses, green background, go Ctrl+shift+R; then go Alt+shift+K, and, in standard color palette, find 'Blue': open the drop-down and choose  'Dark Green' to supplant 'Blue'. Go OK to close the dialog.<br></blockquote>
<img src="companion_files/saveastrolog32.png" align="right"><blockquote>
Go <b>[File] > [Save current settings]</b>, and OK that 'replace file' dialog. (See right).

<div align=center>-------------------------------------------</div><p>
The old-school method is to go <b>[Edit] > [Edit Configuration file]</b> to review and alter, then save  <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>.<p>Close Astrolog32 and re-launch it.<br><blockquote><i>For instance, to set Astrolog32 to text-mode at every launch, open the Config.file, find ";GRAPHICS DEFAULTS" and change the first line:<br>
<b>=X</b><br>to<br><b>_X</b><br>
Save the file..<br>
Close Astrolog32 and re-launch it.<p>
Or, to set Astrolog32 permanently to the display of, say, a derestricted spread of minors, true nodes rather than mean: find the line starting
<b>-YR 11 21</b> ..and change  all the ones that follow to zeroes;<br> find 
 <b>_Yn</b>, and change it to <b>=Yn</b>.<br>Save the file..<br>Close Astrolog32 and re-launch it.</i><p>

<br><b>Things that can't be made default are</b>:<br>
1. The Fixed Stars: they won't appear until called.<br>
2. The harmonic that Astrolog32 launches with: that's Harmonic 1 only.<br>
3. Astrolog32 can't launch with other than a one chart graphic complete with info sidebar; or with a text-list of positions.<br>
4. Chart at launch cannot be other than Earth-centred.<p></blockquote>

<h3><a name="Atlas">- THE ATLASES - two wonderful gazetteers.</a></h3><p>
These are designed to be accessed when you have the <b>[Edit] > [Edit chart data..]</b> dialog box open. When you click on <b>Call Atlas</b>, it presents you with special fields to fill in.<br>Then, so long as you have the two Atlases installed, the Longitude, Latitude &amp; Name fields will then be filled in for you.<p>Default search is USA, so if you want International, click to that choice first-off, then select the Country. For USA, it's State that must be selected first. <p><b>NOTE</b>: the atlases are quite unconnected with the timezone selection, which must be done manually.<p>
<b>Jumping to the Country, or State (US).</b> The lists of all countries (states) are too long to scroll, and keying the first letter of the country's name makes the list scroll down closer to your target: the 'down' arrow-key take you the rest of the way.<p>


In the next field, to browse for a placename you can't spell or remember exactly, try the first few letters only, and the atlas will filter you a manageable selection. Further clues in the listings include the zone of the country (international) or state county zone (american), and, where applicable, the population of US american townships. If this doesn't unearth your place, you can browse all the locations in any State or Country in Blocks. That you can start with the First Block, or the Middle, testifies to the fact that, in Texas alone, the First Block only runs from 0 thru' B!<p>
Both Atlases are very extensive, and, if you have TimeZone data to hand as well, you have a terrific tool for locating co-ordinates. (Much credit to Antonio Ramos!)<p>
It is also true that you can add to these atlas files, inserting your own particular locations: the <f1>.atl</f1> files open in Notepad.</blockquote>
<p><div align="center"><img src="companion_files/atlasesmod3.JPG" width="670" height="426" alt="" title="Navigating Atlas dialog" border="0" align="" /></div><p><blockquote><blockquote>In most location results, the upright separators in the string define:<ul><li>
<f2>Feature Name</f2> | <f2>Cell Name</f2> | <f2>County Name</f2>  % <f2>Search field</f2> @ <f2>longitude latitude</f2></li></ul>
.. where, "Feature" is a name in the atlas. It can be a town, village, hospital, school, etc..&nbsp;"Cell"  means a geographical region where the feature is found. 
<br>
"Use first part of feature name as Chart name" box (top right), can save a bit of typing.</blockquote>
<p>

&nbsp;<b>NOTE 1</b>: Also, you don't have to use the atlases - typing in co-ordinates in the relevant fields in the <b>[Enter/edit.. data]</b> window, and inserting some name in the Location field, works fine.<p>
&nbsp;<b>NOTE 2</b>: Hitting the Return-key to OK your &quot;first letters&quot; of some town or city, will bounce you out of the Atlas! You must use the OK radio-button to raise the list of possibles.<p>
</blockquote><p><img src="companion_files/Minutes-in-Seconds.PNG" width="134" height="564" align="right" /> <img src="companion_files/asterisk_YeL.gif" /> It has become a vogue in Wikipedia and elsewhere when giving co-ordinates, to express parts of a degree in decimal: to right is a converter, decimal to minutes - you can interpolate to 30 secs of arc.
<p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" />  In the atlas name field, putting any accents over letters will confuse it, the same goes for apostrophes although they may appear in the name you get back.<p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> For charts at latitudes North of 67 degrees N., or south of 67 degrees S., you will get "The Koch (or Placidus, or other) system of Houses is not calculated at extreme latitudes.". Still I find after 'OK'ing these warnings a chart appears, which may be serviceable, before the program crashes.<p>

<div align="center">--------------------- --------------------</div><blockquote>

Absent from any listings is Curacao (but it's now "Netherlands Antilles"), also Babylon is absent when so spelled. (It's 'Babil', in Iraq country file).  For Jerusalem, insert 31n46, 35e14: - for Babylon, insert 32n32, 44e25. The Baikonur Cosmodrome is at 45n58 63e18, the Kennedy Space Centre is at 28n35 80w40.

Next, right-click on <f1>country_list.atl</f1> in <f1>\international</f1>, choose 'Properties', and untick 'Read only'.<br>
Finally, open it in Notepad and delete every entry from <f2>af.atl afghanistan</f2> down, excepting only <f2>in.atl india</f2> and <f2>pk.atl pakistan</f2>. Save, and when you open the international atlas, only India and Pakistan are offered.

<b>GEOMETRY</b>:<i> in graphical mode</i>:<p>
<b>[Extra] > [Modify Chart]</b> shifts the Chart Angles, squeezing some signs within the Zodiac circle, and stretching others, so that the Vertical appears at right-angles to the Horizon. A toggle switch does this as well, a zero ('0'). As well, the two options in <b>[Charts]</b> menu, <b>[Standard Wheel/List]</b>, and <b>[HouseWheel]</b> toggle the same difference.<p> 
<div align="center">--------------------- --------------------</div><p>
<b>COLOURS</b>:<i> in graphical mode</i>:<p><img src="companion_files/colorcodes4ast.png" width="219" height="154" alt="" title="palette, colour-numbers" hspace="8" border="0" align="right" />All windows appear by default with a blue background, to be easy on the eye. This can be changed in the Configuration File, at <f6>-Yk</f6> entries in the  ;DEFAULT COLORS listings. The default '4' (after the two character-spaces), in '<b>Main Colors</b>', is responsible for that dark blue; change to '2' for a different background. That '2' is a dark green, ..rather hohum .. Maybe black? For black, put a zero.<br>
(That suggested setting of the background to '2' would make any green objects on it already defined as '2' disappear.. so, the 'Default Colors' are best changed after due consideration to the colours of objects and points).<p>
<!--  467 126 -->
<img src="companion_files/defas.png" title="Planets' & Aspects"  hspace="8" align="right"> Other coloured parts of the chart are:<br>
the  planets and points, according to an element associated with them;<br>
the aspect-lines;<br>the corner decoration.<br>

See the last part of this guide (<b><a href="#Config">CUSTOMIZING DEFAULTS via CONFIG.FILE</a></b>: <i>entry-line <f6>-Yk</f6></i>) for the old-school method to do this.

<br clear="right"> <p>Alternatively - go <b>[Settings] > [Color settings]</b> to alter what you have, using available drop-down colours to replace the defaults, this is a good choice in the situation where you haven't already changed the defaults (such as after an installation). But, take a screenshot of Color Settings dialog-box, after you've modified it, and before you go 'OK', so that you have a papertrail of changes.<br></blockquote>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" />  While dark colours have less glare, a white background uses less ink. Use keyboard keys 'm' then 'x' (these are toggles) to thin out /reverse colours, according to your needs. These switches reverse or reduce colours in all the windows Astrolog offers, (even the white-on-black text lists). In graphics mode, when you select 'monochrome', elements light-coloured reduce to 'background' colour, elements dark-coloured reduce to 'lines' colour, and the corner decoration persists. So it's a tri-chrome.<p><div align="center">--------------------- --------------------</div><p>
<blockquote>
<b>CHART SIZE</b>:<i> in graphical mode</i>:<p>
If you want your chart clearer, or bigger, or smaller, the default size can be altered.<br>
For clearer charts, set your resolution higher. A vertical size of 701 makes a big chart if you have a 768 x 1024 screen.<br>

For  800 x 600 screens, a vertical size of 528 takes up the whole screen. The dialog boxes are bigger.<p>
These dimensions can be reset in <b>[Settings] > [Graphics Settings]</b>; you must save the Config. file, then re-launch. (See also <b><a href="#FAQ">F.A.Q.s</a></b>)</blockquote> 

<div align="center">-------------------------------------------</div>
<blockquote>
<b>IMAGING</b>:<i> in graphical mode</i>:<p>
After going <b>[Edit] > [Copy chart as bitmap]</b> with the graphical chart, then the chart, astrograph, dispositor page, map, aspect grid or any other chart can be pasted into MSPaint or other suitable image editor, for subtler colours in your own background; and different Astrolog windows can ultimately be brought together into a compound image, for your gallery or to print off.
<div align="center"><img src="companion_files\topbit.PNG"></div><br>
With <b>[File] > [Save chart as bitmap]</b> (Ctrl+6), Astrolog by default will save a 24-bit bitmap - a very large filesize, and unnecessarily full of colour-writes, since Astrolog <b>only uses 16 colours!</b>. Opt, in the 'file as type' box, for 'All Files', and add the suffix <f8>.png</f8>, or <f8>.gif</f8> to the filename, - much better than adding big bitmaps to your harddrive.</blockquote><br>
 <img src="companion_files/repaste.gif" width="332" height="277" title="Paste again & again" hspace="8" align="right">
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> Astrolog uses a lot of fine lines, becoming thinner as your chart gets bigger. To avoid the 'spidery' look in a final print or image, you can, with little trouble, make the image bolder (see right).<br>Go <b>[Edit] > [Copy chart as bitmap]</b>, then paste into MSPaint; then set 'Zoom' to x6.<br>Set 'Select' with 'Paste transparent'; left-click on the 'Dipper', and right-click on the background colour.<br>
Go Ctrl+a, and then, Ctrl+c.<br>
Now paste again - nothing appears to alter, but if you left-click-&amp;-drag on the new layer, it slides over the old one; slide it one 'bit', to left or to right; now paste again, this time sliding up, or down one 'bit'.<br>
Now Zoom out, and your image is bolder, or more luminous.<br>Save as .PNG or .GIF.

&nbsp;&nbsp;  the keyboard switch 'x' inverts all colours, 'm' reduces the palette - only three colours, those you have defined as the default's 'blue' and the default's 'white', plus the corner decoration, will be used. In these images from version 1.30, blue had replaced my default 'white' (see <b>[Settings] > [Color Settings]</b>), and black my default 'blue', so on inversion, 'my' blue swapped to red, as 'my' black swapped to white, and my red corners became green.<br>(May be different default colours in version 2.)<p>

<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> <b>What You see Is What You Get!</b> - printing from the program, charts (though not text) will reflect exactly what you have onscreen, except that if the chart is oblong <b>through resolution </b>issues, it will still print round; and making the chart smaller with the pull-handles, or oblong, or without a sidebar - that's how it will appear.
<p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> A macro can be put together which when run, will alter some or all the colours, geometry, size, or other options, for the duration of your session. See <b><a href="#Comm">MACRO OPTIONS</a></b> together with the Helpfile, for a hint as to how.<p>

<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> Text in astrolog32's graphics charts is bitmapped, which gives the program its clunky look. If you're seeking something more DTP in Astrolog's presentations, the chart panel can be created using Windows' Courier &amp; Wingdings fonts, while there is also a freeware symbol-font for the charts, (Mr Hirst's font.. see www.bonniehill.net); these will enhance the charts. See <b>[Miscellaneous Settings]</b>, or check out switch <f6>-XM , -XMO</f6> in the helpfile (<b>[Help] > [Open Helpfile]</b>) for details, so as to modify the Config. file correctly.<p>

Sweden started to change from the Julian calendar in 1700, but it was decided to make the (then 11-day) alteration gradually, excluding the leap days (29 February) from each of the eleven leap years, over 1700 to 1740 - the difference would not be constant, but change every 4 years.<br>But the leap days that should have been excluded from 1704 and 1708 were not excluded - they were still in fact 10 days behind. King Charles XII abandoned it - it was decided to revert to the Julian calendar. This was achieved by introducing the unique date 30 February in 1712, adjusting the discrepancy in the calendars from 10 back to 11 days. Sweden and Finland finally adopted in 1753.. Wednesday, 17 February, was followed by Thursday, 1 March.</i><p>
<div align="center"><b>Anyway, Astrolog automatically uses the Julian calendar for dates before October 4, 1582, <br>and automatically uses the Gregorian calendar for dates after October 15, 1582</b></DIV><blockquote>This means that no adjustments need to be made before October 15th 1582 if you have the assurance that your datum is Julian.<br>Pre-Roman, or Babylonian charts are an extra few pen-on-paper calculations away, unless you luckily know the Julian Day of the event: to get to the exact day in these calendars often involves counting the days from a month's start, which itself is defined by a moon-phase (livius.org and tyndalehouse.com have good information on their diverse counts - sometimes the whole year must be reckoned), but, with Astrolog32, you can find by inspection new moons after an equinox; and most ancient day-counts were reckoned from such new moons.</blockquote>

<a name="b1">You</a> can reckon to gain or lose two hours for each 30 degrees of 'easting' or 'westing', from your pc's time. So, if it's 9am in Cairo, and Beijing being 90 degrees <b>east</b> of Cairo, then it's 3pm in Beijing..3 x 2 hours <b>ahead</b> (each line on map marks two hours' rotation).<p>
<div align="center"><img src="companion_files/world_map6.gif" width="890" height="440" alt="" title="" border="0" align="" /></div><p>So, how to apply a timezone adjustment in the 'TimeZone' field, by entering additional or subtracted hours manually, - useful where the drop-down timezones are not available: bear in mind that your Astrolog32 <b>is already registered</b> to your local or preferred time-zone, and the shift you make is with reference to <b>that</b> timezone. 
<blockquote><img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" /> But first, an easy pitfall, which is, 
failing to remember if you have DST set as default, or a summertime addition already set in your current session.. (if you have this, the 'Summer Time' field will say 'Yes').<p>

 You must first:

<ul><li>If you have DST 'on', and it won't apply in this case, take it off!</li><p><li>Choose or type in one of the 'Time Zone' letter-codes - see table below.</li><p><b>OR</b><p>
<li>Look up/reckon the time difference - in the <b><a href="companion_files/times.html" target="blank">World Time-Offsets to UT, &amp; DST</a></b> daughter-page some timezone info sites are listed besides the data there - most of them give the time difference from UT (I think), so chances are, some math may be involved to find the correct number of hours for <b>you</b> to shift<br>apply the difference in time as an 'easting' or 'westing'.
<br>
<p>


EASTING:<blockquote> to apply a <b>gain</b> of <f2><i>x</i></f2> hours from your home timezone, (i.e. for timezones east of where you are), you will enter minus 1 hour (put <f2>-1:00</f2>) for places a single time zone away; minus 2 hours (<f2>-2:00</f2>), two zones away, and so on. From UT in the UK, it's generally minus 3 (<f2>-3:00</f2>) for Baghdad, minus 10 hours (<f2>-10:00</f2>), for Australia NSW;<br> from Pacific Standard Time (PST) in USA, it's minus 3 (<f2>-3:00</f2>) for EST New York. This is for guidance only - these examples take no account of any local Daylight Saving adjustments.</blockquote>

WESTING:<blockquote> to apply a <b>loss</b> of <f2><i>x</i></f2> hours to your local timezone, (i.e., for timezones which run behind your local time,- that is for places west of your location), you will enter hours without the minus: e.g 3 hours (<f2>3:00</f2>) for California, if you're on Eastern Standard Time. So, from UT in the UK, apply 5 hours (<f2>5:00</f2>) to locate yourself in Eastern Standard Time US, or apply 8 hours (<f2>8:00</f2>) for Los Angeles. Again, this example takes no account of local Daylight Saving adjustments.</li><p><li>

<h3><a name="Comm">- COMMAND SWITCH, MACRO &amp; HARMONIC OPTIONS -</a></h3><blockquote>Command-line remains the most potent and fast interface to Astrolog32, though some switches have lost functionality in successive incarnations of Astrolog.<p>Essential nonetheless, if you want to:<ul><li> execute one command-switch, for a feature which only command switches access..</li><li>execute a string of different commands altogether, as, where you want to customize the program straight after launch, or if you want to reach extended or compound options</li></ul>



For instance: typing <f6><b>/l /m</b></f6> and 'OK'ing it, Astrolog32 will show the planets in Gauquelin Sectors, and a midpoint list, cumulatively; remember, only in text-mode, though.<p>


The results often will not appear except in text-mode, so select that as required.<p>Command switches, and macros which are chains of command-switches, work through going <b>[Run] > [Open Command Line]</b>, - or, much simpler, pressing 'Return' key! - once to open <b>[Run]</b>; then type in the switch(es), then Return again to make it happen. 
<img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" /> Getting back to your point of starting though, means you need to know the switches in enough depth to configure the program back again.</blockquote>
<div align="center">--------------------- ---------------------</div><b>Command Switches:</b><br>
<blockquote>
Find switches listed by opening the page <b>Command and Obscure Switches</b> <a href="companion_files/switches.html" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>. It's not exhaustive; there are also other abstruse switches which you may find in the Helpfile.</blockquote>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> <b> Command Switches are case-sensitive!</b><p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> Between successive switches, include a space between each switch - in which case, <b>do not include the semi-colons!</b>
<p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" />  In the command list below, <i>greater than/less than</i> symbols ('<'
and '>') are used to enclose a command switch parameter to be replaced
by the appropriate value.<p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> Brackets ('<f6>[</f6>' and '<f6>]</f6>') are used to enclose
an optional parameter.<p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> Commas are used to separate <i>either/or</i>
choices.<p>
For example, the specification of the <f6>-I</f6> switch is &quot;<f6>-I
[</f6> < <f6><i>columns</i></f6> > <f6>]</f6>&quot;, meaning that one can specify the <f6>-I </f6> switch, followed a
parameter for the number of screen columns, but that this extra
parameter is optional. Another example: the specification of the <f6>-Xs</f6> switch is &quot;<f6>-Xs
< 100,200,300,400 > </f6>quot;, meaning it can be used as either &quot;<f6>-Xs 100&quot;, &quot;-Xs
200&quot;, &quot;-Xs 300</f6>&quot;, or &quot;<f6>-Xs 400</f6>&quot;.<p><img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> An ellipsis ('<f6>..</f6>') generally refers to
a variable length list of values or an abbreviation for something
already indicated in related switches.

<p><b>Macros</b>:<blockquote>
Any macros, once you have defined them, can be called <img src="companion_files/macromin.JPG" width="247" height="445" alt="" title="call a macro" border="0" hspace="8" align="right" /> by the function keys "<b>F1</b>, F2, .. ", (and subsequently Shift+function-key, then Alt+function-key.., and so on to get to the higher numbers). So Astrolog32 uses the 'F' keys as switches to execute the macros that you've already defined for yourself. None are pre-defined in Astrolog32's versions up to V.2.02.<p><div align="center">For more info, seek out the sections on <f6><b>-Q</b></f6> or <f6><b>-M0</b></f6>, in the old Helpfile, which is in <b>[Help]</b>.</div><br><b>Defining your macros</b><br>To define what each macro is to be, just use the command-line itself! Put in <b>this special switch</b>:<br>enter <f6><b>-M0</b></f6>, then a space, then the number of the macro that you want to use, e.g. <f6><b>1</b></f6>, then the string you have in mind <f6><b>/something /something</b></f6>.<br>Click 'OK' or press Enter to confirm the macro.<br>Until then, you will get the warning "Macro number one is not defined".<br>In Astrolog32 V.2.04, three macros are offered in the package.<br clear="right"></blockquote><br><img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> Macros, once saved, will appear as the <b>last entry</b> of the Config.file.<p><div align="center">---------------------<a href="#Menu"><img src="companion_files/arrow_up1.png" width="18" height="18" alt="Return" title="Return to MENU" border="0" align="center" /></a>--------------------</div>
<p>
<b>Harmonic charts</b>:<blockquote>
these are accessible in text and graphics mode, via the command line in <b>[Run]</b>. Typing '<f6>x 2</f6>' (without the hyphens) will raise the second harmonic when you click OK. For the third harmonic, it's '<f6>x 3</f6>', &amp; so on. Note the space between the x and the figure. The Angles and houses do not mutate, which is at once practical, yet to my mind astrologically unhelpful; in fact, the chart's orientation remains as the Radical chart.</blockquote>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_orA.gif" /> Harmonic charts will not save as normal <f1>.dat</f1> files other than at harmonics other than Harmonic 1 (the Radical), - the only option then is to go <b>[File] >[Save Chart positions..]</b>, and save  them as *<f1>pos.dats</f1>.<p>
<img src="companion_files/asterisk_yeL.gif" /> Default on re-launch remains Harmonic 1, but if, during one session, you have set the Harmonic at a particular value in a chart - all subsequent charts you move on to will be shown at the same harmonic, until you go back to harmonic one via the command line!, or via <b>[Settings] > [Calculation Settings]</b> dialog!<p>

In the Command-line, type '<f6>x 1</f6>', (without the inverted commas), and click 'OK' to return to the First Harmonic, i.e the Radical.<p>

<a name="Config">
<b><h3>- CUSTOMISING DEFAULTS via CONFIG. FILE -</h3></b></a><blockquote>
Config.file is a short text-file. At every launch Astrolog32 reads this file, and does what it says. Called <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>, it is most easily viewed while the program is open (keyboard switch is Ctrl+shift+0 (zero)), or by going <b>[Edit] > [Edit Configuration File</b>]. Or, without opening Astrolog32, if you navigate to the Astrolog32 folder and open it, then open the <f1>\main</f1> folder to locate it, then Notepad can open it - ('though Windows may tell you it can't: go 'pick program from a list > Notepad').<br><p>

CONTENTS of the Config.file: each line covers a separate topic, and changes need to be done with some attention not to disrupt the order of 'flags' and spaces.<br>
The lines start with a line-flag, (which you may be able to alter to 'off', or to 'on' - see on..). Sometimes the next bit is a range parameter (not to be altered). Then a string of numbers or zeroes follow. A semi-colon marks the end of the working code, and the start of a comment about how to alter it.
<p> The changes you make need to be saved, in order for them to become the new defaults. After saving, your alterations will appear at the next session.
<p>From the section DEFAULT RESTRICTIONS; here is line 2 (and green marks the spaces between flags):<p>
<div align="center">
<img src="companion_files/example1png1.png" width="387" height="49"></div>
<br>
&nbsp; What this line declares is:<p>
&nbsp; <b>first</b>, the code <b>YR</b> that says it's an Overall Restriction / Allowing-of-Objects switch-line: it has the line 'switched on'; (to switch it off, you can put <b>=YR</b>, at the front, instead of <b>-YR</b>)<br>
&nbsp; there's a space, then, <b>second</b>, there's a range-parameter <b>11 20</b>, (MINORS &amp; POINTS), and tells Astrolog32 it is the minor planets &amp; points to be switched in this set, for calculation and showing.<br>&nbsp;  <b>Last</b>, and after TWO spaces, the place in the string of <b>0</b>s & <b>1</b>s that follow, defines <b>which</b> minor planet or calculated point you are switching; - minors are always in this order:
</blockquote><div align="center"><b>Chiron,Ceres,Pallas,Juno,Vesta,N.Node,S.Node,Lilith,Pars,Vertex,East Point</b><blockquote>
~ here those '<b>0</b>' are '<b>ON</b>', (namely Chiron, N.Node, S.Node, Pars, Vertex, East Point),<br>while '<b>1</b>'  at a position signifies <b>OFF</b>. 
<p>
For this line, zero (<i>on</i>), or one (<i>off</i>), are the only options for the positions in the flag-parameters' string in this line.</blockquote></div>
<img src="companion_files/banana-peel-6.gif" width="31" height="30" alt="" title="Banana Skin" border="0" align="" /> You should not touch the range-parameters.<p>
<div align="center">-------------------------------------------</div><p>
<b>FLAGS &AMP; SPACES GENERALLY:</b><p>Often, an initial underscore (_) toggles the line's status from (=) , and an 'o' (oh) toggles the line's status from (-) ; ..these are Astrolog's most common 'flags' for signalling <b>on/off</b> of a particular entire entry-line.<p>
 ALSO, Where there is a range parameter after the letter-code, then (except in DEFAULT GRAPHICS &amp; one or two other sections), there are always 2 LETTER-SPACES between the 'range parameter' and the string of 'flag-parameter' numbers.</i>

<b>SNAPSHOTS &amp; BACK-UPS</b>:<p> At any stage in the evolution of your own distinctive <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1> file, in fact, you can save backups from this Notepad window by opening <b>[File] > [Save As ..]</b> (say for instance.. astrolog32_beforeIalteredit.dat), and save it where you like, then close the window.

<b>~ BACKING UP FIRST...</b><br>
As the program relies expressly on this file's instructions and where you've no backup of your chosen set-up in your system, safety suggests, before doing anything to it, to make a backup of astrolog32.dat in its present state<blockquote>by A:- going <b>[Edit] > [Edit configuration file]</b>, and in the Notepad window, going <b>[File] > [Save as ..]</b>(for instance) astrolog32.<b>old</b>; then, doing the edits you want, and re-saving as astrolog32.dat<p>
Or better, B:- via Explorer window by copy/pasting a copy of astrolog32.dat from the <f1>\main</f1> folder, into the <f1>\miscellaneous</f1> folder (and you could rename it), before going ahead and making changes.</blockquote>
<div align="center">You can then proceed with confidence.</div><p>
<i>
(TO ROLL BACK to the BACKUP VERSION: open the folder where the backup was stored, find your backup file, (change your chosen backup file's suffix to ....dat, if that's missing), then open it in Notepad, not in order to alter it but just so as to re-save it under the title that Astrolog looks for, <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>, saving back in <f1>\main</f1> folder.

<a name="FAQ"><h3>- F.A.Q.s and ABOUT -</h3></a><p>

<f4>What is Astrolog32?</f4><br>
Free to download &amp; use but with the restriction that it's not for gain, Astrolog32 accurately charts the planetary and star positions, as seen from every Solar System planet (but not their Moons).<br>It is constantly updated, and can give positions (degrees, minutes, seconds), relative to the Zodiac, the ecliptic, and between planets. Extended world-gazetteers and ephemerides (12000BCE - 4000AD) can be added, seen and printed; and for astrologers, short interpretations are made.  
Full details see <a href="#app"><b>APPENDIX</b></a>.<p>

<f4>I have an Old-Style chart datum to raise; can Astrolog32 help?</f4><br>
Yes, automatically, if the datum is pre-1582 (Oct 4th), Astrolog32 will recognise it as such, and make the chart correctly.<br>
for chart-data after that date from those countries which persisted with OS, you must add the appropriate number of extra days, to make the datum NS,- see <a href="#Calend"><b>Julian to Gregorian Calendar</b></a> section.<p>


<f4>My chart isn't round!</f4><br>
Your monitor may have a distorting resolution, and a regular circle really shows this up! Try 800 x 600, 768 x 1024, or 1600 X 1200, on an 4:3 monitor - Astrolog's anticipated format - and all should be well.<br>Most widescreen resolutions also render square, but with others the effect is sometimes inevitable, if there's a mismatch between graphics card and monitor. The good news is, the charts print round if this is the case.<br><i>Efforts to compensate by setting different dimensions (which in the Config.file, are :Xw Default X and Y resolution) is profitless, as Astrolog32 uses only one of these, and reckons the other.</i><p>Check that the chart hasn't been pulled out by happenstance - press a capital Q, to check.<p>
<f4>My chart's too small/ large!</f4><br>
You can make the chart smaller or bigger with the pull-handles that appear at the edges: then, if you press a 'capital Q', the chart will 'square up' from oblong; and that's the size it will then print, or copy at, for the duration of your session. If you go <b>[File] > [Save current settings..]</b>, and click 'Save' and 'Yes' in the box that follows, the new size will appear in future.<p>
The chart can be made permanently larger or smaller by altering the dimensions in the Configuration file, (at the third typed line below &quot;;DEFAULT GRAPHICS&quot; - in other words after the :Xw.<br>To up the size, on a 1024 x 768 resolution, try :Xw <insertgif> 630 630, or bigger, till the scrollers appear. <br>
On 800 x 600, try :Xw <insertgif> 540 540, or bigger, till the scrollers appear.<br>Now, go <b>[File] > [Save Current Settings]</b> and click 'Save' and 'Yes' in the box that follows, over-writing <font color="#7FFFD4">astrolog32.dat</font>). The bigger the chart, the bigger the bitmaps it creates.<br>In similar fashion, you can reduce the size to that of a beermat, with a 387 387 chartsize for a 1024 x 768 screen, 276 x 276 on an 800 x 600 screen.<br>
You can do it via the menus too: Go <b>[Settings] > [Graphics Settings]</b> for the dialog, and alter Horizontal Chart Size - the other dimensions will correct accordingly; again, don't forget to over-write <font color="#7FFFD4">astrolog32.dat</font>.<p>
<f4>What's needed to install Astrolog32?</f4><br>
Unless you are a seasoned user, you need an easy install, and that comes with version 2.5. It comes in a zipped, self-installing download <f2>Astrolog32_v2_05_setup.exe</f2> - check out the two sites listed in FAQs <f4>Where can I get Astrolog32?</f4>.<br>Added to that, though, a read of the Preamble will make you see that it is a software very open to modifying, and the installer hits you with questions straightaway so it can configure itself to<br>1. where you make most charts for<br>2. what timezone you are in<br>3. What's your hometown? and then..<br>4. where to put shortcuts to the program.<br>To get the full works, you will want, now or later, either to expand the atlas to or beyond your home country, or use past centuries of ephemerides for seriously historical charts, which will mean downloads of 'country files', or more <f1>.se1</f1> files, zipped, from Astro.com (see how above, 'atlas' or 'ephemeris' sections).<br>If you are offline, you can import the zipped installer on media, - if in the US, consider getting your state's <f1>.atl</f1> file from <a href="http://www.southville.net/astrolog32/en/atlas.html" target="_blank"><b>Southville</b></a> at the same time. Details in <a href="#Atlas"><b>ATLASES</b></a>.<br>
See below for the minimum hardware requirement, <f4>What is Astrolog32's  minimum hardware?</f4>.<p>
<f4>I've just installed Astrolog32: - what's this about "cannot find configuration file"?</f4><br>
In this guide's <b>TOPICS MENU</b> is a clickable link - 'Cannot find Configuration file' - this will call a help-document on this subject; here's a <b><a href="companion_files/noconfig.html" target="_blank">direct link</a></b>.<p>

<f4>I've set up charts #1 and #2: how do I get my bi-wheel?</f4><br>
It only remains then to go <b>[Charts] > [Two wheels]</b>.<br>
To turn multiwheels off again, go <b>[Charts] > [Relationship mode OFF]</b>.
<p>
<f4>How do I display dates as D/M/Y, or M/D/Y; also 24-hour times, instead of am/pm</f4><br>
Go <b>[Settings] > [Miscellaneous]</b>, and make the change. Go <b>[File] > [Save current settings]</b> and save <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>.<br>
Otherwise these can only be altered by editting the config.file - lines 26 and 27, changing the prefixes to ' <b>Yd</b>' and/or ' <b>Yt</b>' - an explanation is provided there.<p>
	
<f4>Program opens with original defaults, although I change settings each session!</f4><br>
Those changes aren't over-writing your defaults - after you have set it up in your <b>current</b> session as you want, go <b>[File] >[Save current settings]</b> &amp; save <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>.<br>Some settings can't be made default: Star Selections in Fixed Stars, alternative mode, particularly, must be re-selected for each session; and Fixed Stars must always be called to view - it's never default.<p>

<f4>Is uninstalling Astrolog32 a big deal?</f4><br>
Quite the opposite: just navigate to the Astrolog32 folder, right-click it, and go 'Delete'. Everything will go, as Astrolog doesn't touch the Windows Registry. Only the shortcut, (in Start Menu or Desktop), will remain to be deleted.<br>
The latest releases of Astrolog32 have an uninstaller, which you will find in your Astrolog32 folder, (click on <f1>unins000.exe</f1>).<p>

<f4>What is Astrolog32's minimum hardware?</f4><br>
Old stuff will do superbly: a 4:3 monitor, big or small, plus a quiet machine - 500 Mhz processor I would call adequate but could be down to 300 Mhz; a 4GB harddrive (Xp;  Vista needs more everything!); a USB slot; a likeable keyboard AND mouse.<br>I suggest running it on NTFS Windows systems, not Win98 or Millenium: try Win2000 Pro (NTFS version); or Xp, as minimums.<br>Set your screen resolution to 800 x 600. And if you're keen on your astrological work, a dedicated pc is a nice option.<p>

<f4>Can I use Astrolog32 for clients' charts?</f4><br>
It's a condition of all Astrolog releases is that they are not used for monetary gain. See <f1>Helpfile.txt</f1> for details<p>
<f4>How should I make my chart printable, not wasting a lake of ink? </f4><i>(applies versions before version2)</i><br>
Go <b>[View]</b>, tick <b>[Reverse background]</b> &amp; tick <b>monochrome</b>  .. WYSIWYG! Or, better, simply hit the m key, then x, on the keyboard; or just go x key, and send to the printer, letting it greyscale the colours.
<p>
<f4>How do I change my default location co-ordinates (Lat. &amp; Long)?</f4><br>
1.Go via menus: <b>[Edit] > [Set Default Location/ Timezone..]</b> and alter the co-ordinates, by browsing the atlases offered; go <b>[File] > [Save current settings.. ]</b>, overwriting <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>.<br>or...<br>
2a. Find your intended co-ordinates by browsing online for them, and write down the co-ordinates.<br>
2b. Go <b>[Edit] > [Edit Configuration File]</b>, alter line 13 of <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1>, after <f2>-zl </f2>; and in line 14 type in the Location's name, e.g.<br><f2>-zn &quot;<i>Nowhereville</i>&quot;</f2>; Save.<p>

<f4>How best can I find my way through <f1>Helpfile.doc</f1>?</f4><br>
With difficulty. I prefer Helpfile.txt, but they are both gadabout &amp; antiquated in the info provided; generally, I open a Find box (Ctrl+f), then type in one word or, better, a switch that may lead me roundabout to a paragraph that may refer to the topic I want: I have to read all the results! - Valentin Abramov's additions (on 5.41G) which now are added to the original Helpfiles are a lucid exposition of his changes.<br>Users of these documents need to understand:<br>
1. a bit about program routines, and a lot about Astrolog's capabilities already.<br>
2. command line switches are the anticipated way of working.<br>
3. tag-brackets like < and > are used to enclose where a number is required, but you are not expected to use the tag-brackets in your switches, or the semi-colons that merely mark where the code ends, and the explanation begins.<br>
 (A helpfile.html may be on its way!). See also, in version 2.x, <f1>History 541g.txt</f1>, which is hidden in the <f1>\main</f1> folder, though it needs a re-write.<p>
<f4>How can I print off a list of all my charts' names?</f4><br>
Windows can do this, with an old command, using the command-line:<ul><li>In folder window, navigate to the <f1>\charts</f1> folder, and right-click any folder or file <b>within it</b>: choose 'Properties'.</li><img src="companion_files/A3slo.gif" hspace="6"align="right"><li>Find and highlight <b>all</b> of the path, in the 'Location' field. (see image, right). Go Ctrl+c.</li><li>Paste the path (it will end <f1>...\charts</f1>) in a new Notepad page, and close the folder window.</li><li>Open Prompt window with <b>[Start] > [Programs] > [Accessories] > [Command Prompt]</b>.</li><li>Tile windows</li><li>At the blinking cursor at 
the end of the opening line, in Command Prompt window, type:<f2>cd</f2>, then a space, then the whole of the address path, letter by letter, from the Notepad page. Press 'enter' key.</li><li>At the new Prompt, type:<f2>dir /s > print.txt</f2> and press 'enter': this will send the list to the <f1>\charts</f1> folder, as <f1>print.txt</f1> (omitting <f2>/s</f2> excludes subfolders).</li></ul><br>For best view, open <f1>print.txt</f1> in Wordpad or Word.<br clear="right">
<p>

<f4>Can I make an Excel spreadsheet of ephemeris positions?</f4><br>
Yes, once you have made a text-file of the ephemeris, and then, having spent time inserting commas in each line of data, to demarcate the columns in their order and number, saved it as a <f1>.csv</f1> file.<br>
(To create a more personalised text-file of ephemerides, see above in <b>Entering/ Exitting Text mode</b>, within <a href="#x"><b>Chart #2 > > >text</b></a>.)

<br>But suppose you have gone shift+E, then saved a month's positions', as textfile, to the desktop: at Yahoo's Astrolog_list forum, the suggestion is to open with a text editor like <b>Notepad++</b>, from Notepad-plus-plus.org, so as to use its 'Find &amp Replace' option, in order to insert the essential commas, and remove quotemarks - these will otherwise prevent the grid from transferring properly. Also, excise any unnecessary data, and manually edit the first line, of 'Dy/Mo/Yr' and names-of-objects, removing those forward-slashes, &amp; adding commas to mark off the columns.<br>Then the remaining columns can be marked-up automatically, and quotemarks replaced, using 'Find &amp Replace' in three passes: the first, to replace <f8><b><i>-12</i></b></f8> &nbsp; e.g. the year-ending, with <f8><b><i>-12,</i></b></f8> - so adding a comma; next, to replace <f8><b>'</b></f8> with <f8><b>m.</b></f8> (for minutes of arc), then to replace <f8><b>"</b></f8> with <f8><b>s. ,</b></f8> (for seconds of arc, while at the same time inserting a separating comma after each Object or Node).<br>Alternatively you can open your ephemeris text in <b>MSWord</b>, (set to landscape view, set font to small), and open the Find &amp; Replace dialog which is probably in [Edit] > [Replace]; the routine is the same, but remember to save as Plain Text <f1>.txt</f1>, (or <f1>.csv</f1> if that's an option).<br>
When it's as tidy as is necessary, save the file as a .csv file, (comma-separated-values). Open the spreadsheet program, and go <b>[File] > [Open]</b>, or use 'import csv file, using comma-separated-values'.

<p>
<f4>How do I raise an Harmonic chart?</f4><br>
1. Either press the return key, or Go <b>[Run] > [Open Command Line]</b> : now type &quot;-x 4&quot;, (without the inverted commas), you'll get to the Fourth Harmonic when you press 'OK'. Type &quot;-x 1&quot;, (without the inverted commas) and 'OK' to return to the Radical chart.<br>
2. Another way, open <b>[Settings] > [Calculation settings]</b>, and highlight, then change the number-value in the 'Harmonic' corner. go 'OK'.<br>
3. Or go <b>[Settings] > [Special] > [show decans]</b>, (or 'little g'), for third harmonic, and <b>[Settings] > [Special] > [Show Navamsas]</b>, (or 'little y'), for the ninth.
See also 'F.A.Q - smallest aspect' below.<p>
<f4>I'm lost! How do I get back to the vanilla chart?</f4><br>
Go <b>[View] > [Graphics Mode]</b>; or type little 'v', for starters; but <b>[Charts] > [Biorhythm]</b> &amp; <b>[Lists] > [Arabic Parts]</b> are particularly sticky... Alt+shift+V is your get-out-of-jail card: and maybe, also go <b>[Charts] > [Relationship Mode OFF]</b>, or type little 'c' - this will end the displaying of surplus charts.<br>After progressing a chart, since there's no undo, you'll have to un-tick 'Do Progression' in <b>[Charts] > [Progressed]</b>, then go 'OK'.<br>
It can be defeating to have to reopen the sourcefile via <b>[File] > [Open ..]</b>. A way round this is to go <b>[Edit] > [save Current Chart data in memory]</b> when the radical chart's first raised, before you start your exploration, progression or rectification, then recall it in the <b>[Edit] > [Recall chart data from memory]</b>.<p>

	<f4>Can I view transits in a bi-wheel chart, objects moving (graphics mode), relative to the fixed natal positions? Or progressing planets, relative to natal?</f4><br>
Yes. As Mainchart, raise the chart that is <b>not</b> to alter; setup the chart that <b>is</b> to alter as "chart #2": go <b>[Charts] > [Biwheel]</b>; when you press little 'p', the outer chart, (chart #2), will progress by the Jump Factor till you press it again. See the keyboard switches section for how to set Jump factor quickly.
<p>
<f4>Can I view a given chart move 'across the sky' as time ticks forward?</f4><br>
Yes, but first choose your interval: minutes?, days?, months?.. Go <b>[Animation] > [Jump Rate] > [Minutes]</b> (for rectifying a birth, for example), then go <b>[Animate]</b>. There is a <b>[Reverse direction]</b> toggle in the Animation menu. Clcking <b>[Animate]</b> again turns the time-shift off at the point you choose, though you need to be cat-quick, and the keystroke control of this, with <i>p</i> and <i>r</i>, is far more handy.<br>This animation works to visualise the sky in <b>[Charts] > [Local Horizon]</b>, and <b>[Charts] > [Solar system]</b>, also <b>[Extra] > [Constellations ON]</b> with <b>[Extra] > [Bonus Mode]</b> too.<p>
When animation is running, pressing numbers 2 through 9 will multiply the Jump Rate - it can gallop forward forward, or back, till you press 1 again.
<p>
<f4>Where can I incorporate some Uranian objects?</f4><br>
Go <b>[Settings] > [Object Selections]</b> and check if there are ticks by the Uranians - add all or some.<br>Go <b>[Settings] > [Cusps &amp; Uranians]</b>; see that Orbs are 360 degrees, and under &quot;Add&quot; and &quot;Influence&quot;, &quot;0.0&quot; here indicates that the objects have not been weighed for more orb, nor power - those numbers can be upped to your choice.<br>
To make your selections permanent, now go <b>[File] > [Save current settings]</b>. Save, overwriting <f1>astrolog32.dat.</f1><p>

<f4>Is Astrolog32 stable?</f4><br>Fairly so: I've had two A32 break-ups in ten years, each remedied by finding a fresh copy of the <f1>\main</f1> folder, and overwriting the one that was defective (having first taken out the old <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1> that I liked, and kept it aside during the replacement, to go back then and replace the default version in the new <f1>\main</f1>.)<br>But first, check your <f1>astrolog32.dat</f1> file is not corrupt.<br>
<img src="companion_files/subsequentnag.gif" align="left">&nbsp; potential indicators of a dodgy <f1>\main</f1> folder..<img src="companion_files/proxynainsnagonopeningmin.gif" align="right"><br clear="left"><p>

<f4>What's the smallest aspect Astrolog32 calculates?</f4><br>
Semisextile. 'half-a-semiSquare' is not listed as an aspect, but can be seen in its Harmonic Realization, by going <b>[Run] > [Open Command Line]</b> > type &quot;x 8&quot;, (without the inverted commas). Then, half-a-semiSquare appears as an opposition.<br>
Type &quot;x 1&quot;, (without the inverted commas), 'OK' to return to primary chart. A similar technique will reveal any small aspect.<p>

<f4>Does Astrolog32 calculate Eris/TransPluto?</f4><br>
No, but there is a way to make Astrolog32 adopt Eris, though it's an involved business. A Swiss Ephemeris file of Eris is available, and so an Uranian or asteroid you don't give any significance to, can be 'kidnapped' - its orbit instead defined by the Eris ephemeris, once you have downloaded that and installed it in \ephemeris. An amended <f1>seorbel.txt</f1> is provided from the site mentioned below, as a template, wherein the Uranian identity 'Vulcanus' is hijacked. Afterwards, that 'Uranian object' must be thought of as Eris, as no object can be renamed by the user.<p>For the how-to of incorporating Eris, see the end of J.M's article at <a href="http://www.bonniehill.net/pages.aux/astrology/astrolog/transpluto.html" target="_blank"><b>Bonniehill.net</b></a>. It's a plunge in the deep end of program how-to.<p>

<f4>How do I get to see current transits in the Houses?</f4><br>
Go <b>[Lists] > [Transits]</b>: opens a window where the day you want can be put in. The list is then presented in text form, and this list should be saved under some name to distinguish it from the chartfile, if that's saved as text also. These save to <f1>\miscellaneous</f1> by default. For House cusps to feature in this list, then in <b>[Settings]</b>, '<b>[Objects Selections > all Cusps]</b>' must all be ticked.
<p>
<f4>Where can I get Astrolog32?</f4><br>
For the latest versions, click the <b>DOWNLOADS</b> link at the head of this guide, or go on the web to <a href="http://www.astrolog32.altervista.org/index_003.htm" target="_blank"><b>Roberto's downloads page</b></a>, and click on the link in blue, &quot;Astrolog32 V2.04 disponibile&quot;, <i>or</i>, &quot;Astrolog32 V2.05 disponibile&quot;. An setup installer is downloaded with the zipped bundle, which will create a directory in 'Program Files' as seen in <a href="#st">Preamble</a>, with basic resources to start you off.<p>
Older versions of Astrolog are downloadable both at Roberto's above, and at <a href="http://www.orionsoft.cz/astrolog32/en/view.asp?page=downloads.htm" target="_blank"><b>the A32 official site</b></a>, and at <a href="http://www.southville.net/astrolog32/en/soft.html" target="_blank"><b>Southville.Net</b></a>, (a site in English (with French an option).

<f4>Is there help online?</f4><br>
Information on particular themes in the use of Astrolog is scattered about the WorldWideWeb, diversely according to the version and language you use.<p>
In english, salient features of Astrolog32 are simply explained at Chris Mitchell's site:<br>http://www.southville.net/Astrolog32/en/Atlases.html &amp; <br>

<div align="center"><b><h3>- ABOUT THE ASTROLOG PROGRAM-MAKERS -</h3></b>

People made it for everyone at no charge:</div><p>
Initial programming was by Walter Pullen in 1990-'91. (<i>X Window graphics initially programmed 23-29 Oct 1991; PostScript graphics initially programmed 29-30 Nov 1992; </i>). He published it with the provision that it is not to be used commercially, and finished development of Astrolog 5.40 for Windows 16-bits on 20th December 1998. Go to <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/home.htm" target="_blank">astrolog.org</a> for details.<p>
Modifications from version 5.40 to 5.41 are by Alois Treindl, who added support for Swiss Ephemeris to 5.41.  Go <a href="http://www.astro.com" target="_blank">astro.com</a> for details.<p>
Valentin Abramov made many improvements to Windows 16-bits versions from 5.30a through 5.31g and 5.41a through 5.41g, up to 26th April 2002.<p>
Antonio Ramos created Astrolog32 (Windows 32-bits version) based on 5.41g. Version 1.0 was released on 5th March 2004. Later versions included improvements to user interface, language support, atlas, etc. Plus, a port to Win32 and other changes are by Antonio Ramos, who declares he is now "taking a rest".<p>Tomas Kubek built the V2 version, (see the residual page <a href="http://www.orionsoft.cz/astrolog32/en/view.asp?page=downloads.htm" target="_blank">here</a>) - this is the current official site; and the the latest version of Astrolog32 is version 2.05, from the current developer, Roberto Luporini.<p>The onus for more change falls on us... <i>Interested?
